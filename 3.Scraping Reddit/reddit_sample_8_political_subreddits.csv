One of the most glaring contradictions in the Mar-a-Lago controversy has been the Justice Department demanding absolute and unwavering secrecy over the FBI raid while officials have been leaking details on the raid. 

The latest example is a report in the New York Times that the Justice Department recovered more than 300 documents with classified markings, citing multiple sources connected to the investigation.

Most judges would be a tad annoyed by the contradiction as the government continues to frame the public debate with its own selective leaks while using secrecy to bar other disclosures. That includes sections of the affidavit that detail the communications with the Trump team, information that is already known to the target.

Someone is clearly lying. The Trump Team said that it was cooperating and would have given access to the government if it raised further objections. The Justice Department has clearly indicated that time was of the essence to justify this unprecedented raid on the home of a former president. Yet, Attorney General Merrick Garland reportedly waited for weeks to sign off on the application for a warrant and the FBI then waited a weekend to execute that warrant. It is difficult to understand why such communications could not be released in a redacted affidavit while protecting more sensitive sections.

The latest leak to to the New York Times offers details on what was gathered from Mar-a-Lago. Officials state that they collected more than 150 documents marked as classified in January with another 150 being gathered in June and then in the August raid.

Washington has long floated on a sea of leaks but this is notable in that the government is opposing even modest disclosures from the court while it has steadily leaked details to its own advantage.

It undermines the credibility of the government and raises questions of the motivations behind the absolute secrecy claims.

The level of detail is extraordinary including the very account of past dealings that some of us have argued could be released in the affidavit. The leaks describe the June meeting in Mar-a-Lago and reveals that Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterespionage section of the national security division of the Justice Department, met with two of Mr. Trumps lawyers, Evan Corcoran and Christina Bobb. He then went through the boxes himself to identify classified material.

This information is likely contained in the affidavit, which the Justice Department claimed could not be released without harming its investigation and endangering national security.

The New York Times story then affirms the position of the Justice Department as proven by the leaks.

[T}he extent to which such a large number of highly sensitive documents remained at Mar-a-Lago for months, even as the department sought the return of all material that should have been left in government custody when Mr. Trump left office, suggested to officials that the former president or his aides had been cavalier in handling it, not fully forthcoming with investigators, or both.

It is litigation by leak where the government prevents others (including the target) from seeing key representations made to the court while releasing selective facts to its own advantage. It shows utter contempt for the court and the public. The question is whether the court will take note of this series of leaks. Most judges do not like to be played so openly and publicly by government officials. Moreover, the leaks should push Garland to reverse course as suggested in a recent column and order substantive disclosures in the affidavit in light of the governments prior leaks.",selftext,/r/Conservative/comments/wvxubv/litigation_by_leak_government_officials_drop_new/,Conservative

###Who is running in this election?

This election is to elect primary challengers for Governor, US Senate and House races as well as state and local legislatures. Some key races are:

**1st District**

Incumbent Matt Gaetz faces a primary challenge from former Fedex executive Mark Lombardo, following accusations that Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws (Gaetz denies any wrongdoing). Gaetz has been endorsed by President Donald J Trump. 

**7th District**
Currently held by a Democrat, the incumbent  Stephanie Murphy has decided to not seek re-election. With changes to the district following redistricting earlier this year, state GOP officials see this as a competitive seat - and the top 3 Republican candidates (Brady Duke, Cory Mills and Anthony Sabatini) have all raised over $1 million in campaign funds to date. 

**13th District**
With a more solidly Republican lean following redistricting earlier this year and the incumbent Democrat stepping down to run for Governor, the race in this district between Air Force veteran Anna Luna (endorsed by Donald Trump) and former prosecutor Kevin Hayslett has become heated - with both candidates raising over $1.5 million in funding.


##New York

###When are polling stations open, and where is my nearest polling station?

Polling stations in New York state are open from 6AM EST to 9PM EST. To find your nearest polling station as well as check your registration status, [click here for the New York State Voter Lookup page](https://voterlookup.elections.ny.gov/).

###Does New York require voter identification?

No, New York state does not require voter ID. 

###Does New York have open primaries?

You cannot vote in a Republican primary if you are registered Democrat to vote in a Democrat primary, or vice versa. You also cannot vote in primaries if you are ""other"", ""no party affiliation"" or a third party.

###Who is running in this election?

This election is to elect primary challengers for Governor, US Senate and House races as well as state and local legislatures. Special elections are also being held to fill the vacant 19th and 23rd district House seats Some key races are:

**12th District - Democrat**

Following redistricting, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D), and U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D) are running in a primary to seek reelection in the general come November alongside newcomers Suraj Patel and Ashmi Sheth. [Recent polling by Emerson College](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/new-york-district-12-poll-nadler-extends-lead-over-maloney-and-patel-in-ny-12-primary/) shows Nadler leading with 43%, followed by Maloney at 24% and Patel at 14%.

**19th District**

This special election is being held to replace the seat vacated by Antonio Delgado after he was selected to become the new Lieutenant Governor. Seen as a competitive district, this election features a face-off between Republican Marc Molinaro and Democrat Pat Ryan. This election has seen major outside spending, with $1.7 million spent by Republican groups and another $500k spent by Democrats. This district is also up for election in November, with both candidates also running in a primary election today. Today's primary is being held under the current district structure, while the general election in November will be held under the new district structure following redistricting earlier this year.

**23rd District**

This election is being held to replace the seat vacated by Republican Tom Reed who vacated the seat after deciding not to seek reelection, and is being held between Republican Joe Sempolinski and Democrat Max Della Pia. Like the 19th District, this seat is also open for the general election in November and a primary election for this district is also being held, with Nicholas Langworthy and Carl Paladino fighting to decide who will run against Max Della Pia in the general.

Bruen in August, seeking to block the legislation.** In response to the lawsuit, Bruens lawyers argued in a court filing that the CCIAs good moral character standard is deeply rooted in Anglo-American legal tradition and should therefore be upheld by the court.

From the early days of English settlement in America, the colonies sought to prevent Native American tribes from acquiring firearms, passing laws forbidding the sale and trading of arms to Indigenous people, the filing reads.

*Bruens lawyers also note that Catholics were barred from owning firearms, both in England and in colonial America, due to their suspected disloyalty.*

**It proves what GOA has been saying for decades, which is that the origin of gun control is racist,** Aidan Johnston, GOAs director of federal affairs, told the Daily Caller. Gun laws come from a majority trying to suppress or dominate or control a minority, whether it be a minority of Catholics in early America, or a minority of Native Americans when theres colonials trying to take over the continent.

In a response to Bruens filing, GOA released a brief Monday detailing ways in which good moral character laws were used to restrict both First and Second Amendment rights from minorities.

Georgias 1840s slave codes, much like the CCIA, prohibited the exercise of First Amendment rights without government licensure, prohibiting any person of color from being allowed to preach or exhort without written license, one of the qualifications of which was proof of the good moral character of the applicant,' GOA wrote in their response to the filing.

**Were pointing out that slave codes  are also the historical basis for denying people their right to carry a firearm on good moral character, obviously in an attempt to show that the root of this requirement is racist and unconstitutional and should be struck down, Johnston told the Caller.**.",comment,/r/Conservative/comments/wwkgpr/goa_and_ny_agree_in_lawsuit_the_historical_basis/illge7h/,Conservative

Russia has annexed and bludgeoned all the countries around it for hundreds of years. Ask yourself, why Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Czechia, Slovenia, Slovakia and multiple other countries(countries which are ethnically slavic) all against Russia geopolitically? Russia frequently hacks their elections, invades its neighbours (Georgia, Ukraine) and forces other countries to be in its orbit. This means they ate compelled to trade and bow to Russia, instead of entering into trade with other countries.

This is extremely negative to the population in question, as countries that do this do not have their interests at heart. For example, Russia does not give a flying shit about Ukrainians and is perfectly fine shoving anyone who disagrees into internment camps. Theyve already been caught stealing Russian grain multiple times, and have also targeted and assassinated Ukrainian politicians and people.

ABSs can be collateralized by either government student loans, guaranteed by the U.S. Dept. of Education, or private student loans. The former have had a better repayment record, and a lower risk of default.

An ABS will usually have three tranches: class A, B, and C. The senior tranche, A, is almost always the largest tranche and is structured to have an investment-grade rating to make it attractive to investors.

Well that's interesting considering thay fact that none of that is even remotely true.

As is shown in [this](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-pelosi-dui-nancy-pelosi-husband-charged-california-crash/#app) article, Paul crashed his car at 10:17 PM. They didn't test him until 12:32 AM, at which point he had a BAC of 0.082% (not 0.002%).

Additionally, according to the [police dash cam footage](https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-highway-patrol-releases-paul-pelosi-dui-video) of the event, Pelosi said he stopped drinking at 8PM. If he stopped drinking at 8PM and was still at 0.082% more than 4 hours later, he would have likely had a BAC of 0.1495%, which is _very_ drunk.

&gt;First DUI you can usually just sit through 2-3x 4 hour classes on a Saturday morning and get it dropped to Reckless Driving (And no probation).

Yes, that's if it's your first (which it wasn't for Paul) and also if it didn't result in any incident. Except for the fact that as reports say, he crashed into another car and caused _significant_ damage to both vehicles, which likely means the other person involved was injured.

Trump is responsible for those losses. The GOP candidate for Senate won more votes on election day in November than Warnock did in the runoff.   Trump and his attorney told Republicans that there was no point in voting, and we lost 2 senate seats.  Those are facts.

The instigator of the raid on Trump was NARA claiming that Trump was in possession of records that were subject to the PRA.  PRA covers of kinds of documents, classified and not.  Obama removed records subject to the PRA.  NARA then had to go to him and recover those documents, which they did albeit after a few years had passed.  

Trump took some documents with him that he says had been declassified.  That very well may be, but NARA can still make a claim to them under the PRA.  It seems that they did so, and they sent people to Trump's home to review the documents.  NARA's people identified and recovered what they were after, and agents requested Trump take extra security to secure some sensitive documents left at the house.  Trump did exactly that.  NARA then sent a thank you letter to Trump for his aid in recovering the PRA records and securing the documents.

Six weeks later, the FBI raids Trump's home claiming they had an informant inside the home who saw top secret documents.  Well, that defies belief given that the FBI already had agents on the property that saw what Trump had, permitted those documents to remain on the property if properly secured, verified they were properly secured, and went on their way.  It is also beyond belief that the FBI received a claim that had any legitimate provenance to justify a raid.

Given all of these facts (none of which are disputed by Trump or the DOJ or even the pundits in the media), we can draw some conclusions about the actions taken by Trump and the FBI in the aftermath of the raid.  The DOJ wants the **entire** affidavit sealed so no one can see why they chose to raid Trump's home.  This really looks bad for them because it makes it seem like one of two things are happening.  Either they received a statement that didn't justify their response, or their statement lacks the provenance to justify a warrant.  You see, provenance matters in the legal world.  You must know the source of information and its motives in order to justify using it.  If the FBI's informant was someone who would not have actually had access to any of the documents in question or even access to the areas of the property that were searched, then the evidentiary statement he/she gave would lack the provenance needed to justify a search warrant.  

If the informant simply stated that they saw documents with a classified marking, that wouldn't justify the raid.  The FBI had already been to the property at the request of NARA and had recovered and reviewed many documents.  A warrant was unnecessary given the Trump's team cooperating willingly with the process.  So, the DOJ may want the affidavit completely sealed because they believe the statement they were given would not justify their raid and will make it obvious they acted politically.

More facts not in dispute about this case.  The judge that authorized the warrant had previously recused himself from hearing a case involving Trump because he said he was too biased against him.  Also not in dispute is the fact that the FBI team that raided the house are the same agents that were responsible for pushing the now debunked Russia collusion claims against Trump.  And AG Garland has a motive to hold a grudge against Trump for denying him a spot on the Supreme Court.  So, this is a **really** bad look for the DOJ.  That affidavit makes them look even worse than they already do.",comment,/r/Republican/comments/wv1pvl/the_trump_maralago_search_was_justified/ilfe7qx/,Republican

As to Trump costing us races...Trump bullied the current, conservative governor of Arizona into not running for Senate.  His choice in the AZ primary is now running 8 points behind Mark Kelly.  The current governor of NH declined to run because of Trump - he was polling ahead of the sitting Dem Senator, the only remaining choices are running behind.  PA looks like another loser, and even Ohio - a seat that should have been a gimme - is now at risk.  

You are right - predictions are guesswork, and some of these weak candidates may yet cross the finish line.  But the probabilities are that we squandered winnable races, the base that keeps nominating poor candidates will blame everyone but themselves, and then whine about how McConnell isn't doing what you want when you have hamstrung the GOP senate caucus.  

Those are on top of both Senate seats in GA and both Senate Seats in Arizona that Trump is responsible for.

Kemp is going to hold the governorship in Georgia despite Trump's attempt to lose it too.  

Do I think it's generally a good thing that Democrats vote in GOP primaries - of course not.  But it's obvious Trump and his minions would rather lose races that nominate winning candidates.   Do you think it's a good thing that the Democrats are going to likely control the Senate next year because Trump would rather have weaker, yes-men as Senators than someone who can win as a Republican?

Trump has convinced his supporters that strong, conservative candidates (Ducey) are RINOs, but leftists, TV celebrities who were Democrats 5 minutes ago are really conservative.

361,"['law enforcement', 'mental health', 'gun owner', 'gun law', 'right', 'bear arm', 'law enforcement']","A  number of politicians and their lobbying partners in the media have  recently sought to disparage Smith &amp; Wesson. Some have had the  audacity to suggest that after they have vilified, undermined and  defunded law enforcement for years, supported prosecutors who refuse to  hold criminals accountable for their actions, overseen the decay of our  countrys mental health infrastructure, and generally promoted a culture  of lawlessness, Smith &amp; Wesson and other firearm manufacturers are  somehow responsible for the crime wave that has predictably resulted  from these destructive policies. But they are the ones to blame for the  surge in violence and lawlessness, and they seek to avoid any  responsibility for the crisis of violence they have created by  attempting to shift the blame to Smith &amp; Wesson, other firearm  manufacturers and law- abiding gun owners.

It  is no surprise that the cities suffering most from violent crime are  the very same cities that have promoted irresponsible, soft-on-crime  policies that often treat criminals as victims and victims as criminals.  Many of these same cities also maintain the strictest gun laws in the  nation. But rather than confront the failure of their policies, certain  politicians have sought more laws restricting the 2nd Amendment rights  of law-abiding citizens, while simultaneously continuing to undermine  our institutions of law and order. And to suppress the truth, some now  seek to prohibit firearm manufacturers and supporters of the 2nd  Amendment from advertising products in a manner designed to remind  law-abiding citizens that they have a Constitutional right to bear arms  in defense of themselves and their families.

To  be clear, a Smith &amp; Wesson firearm has never broken into a home; a  Smith &amp; Wesson firearm has never assaulted a woman out for a  late-night run in the city; a Smith &amp; Wesson firearm has never  carjacked an unsuspecting driver stopped at a traffic light.

Instead, Smith &amp; Wesson provides these citizens with the means to protect themselves and their families.

We  are proud of our 170-year history. We are proud of the commitment of  our employees to making a quality product. We are proud to provide  law-abiding citizens and law enforcement  our customers  with the  tools to provide for their security and independence. We are proud of  our responsible business practices.

We  will continue to work alongside law enforcement, community leaders and  lawmakers who are genuinely interested in creating safe neighborhoods.  We will engage those who genuinely seek productive discussions, not a  means of scoring political points. We will continue informing  law-abiding citizens that they have a Constitutionally-protected right  to defend themselves and their families. We will never back down in our  defense of the 2nd Amendment.

The foundation of our Republics government is the Masonic government triangle of the Judiciary (SCOTUS), Legislative (House and Senate) and the Executive (President). 

The Legislature is supposed to be self-balancing internally between the House and Senate, passing laws by majority vote in both Houses. 

Judiciary is responsible ensuring that the law is Constitutionally sound. 

When the Court needs to enforce the rule of law, the Executive has the responsibility to do so as in *Brown vs Board of Education* 

What would be the result if the Legislative passed a bill that was signed into law by the President but SCOTUS ruled against it only to see the Executive abet the Legislative in implementing that law? 

In 1832, President Jackson did **exactly** that and infamously stating  John Marshal has made his decision, now let him enforce it! 

Today an Executive and Legislative Branch in collaboration - and without accepting any Judicial checks on their power - could run roughshod over American citizens. Right now, States are enacting laws that are ignoring SCOTUS wholesale and the next step would be for the U.S. House and Senate to do the same *and there would be no way to stop them.* 

This is where the 2A has its teeth yet how many complacent Americans and Fudds would just go along with those laws? For that matter, the Pro-2A movement lacks an actual organization and a council of leaders. That used to be the NRA but its internal corruption has crippled it forever. 

Militias? Well, the Fed Bois are members to the point where meetings can start with Okay folks, who here *isnt* a Federal Law Enforcement Agent? - and youd get (maybe) two hands raised.

unconstitutional gun laws around the country have been heading to court.

Please feel free to comment with additional cases of interest, or any other information that might be interesting or useful as we watch these cases progress.

**GUN LAW / POLICY CHANGES**

**California**

On June 24, Attorney General Rob Bonta directed permitting agencies to stop requiring a demonstration of good cause in order to obtain a concealed carry permit, as it was now unconstitutional and unenforceable. He said they could still use other gauges of suitability, like good moral character, and suggested criteria for determining whether an applicant qualifies, including social media searches, character references, a history of racist behavior, financial stability, and honesty and trustworthiness. Bonta also said that permitting authorities can still ask why an applicant wants to carry a gun, even if the answer is no longer allowed to factor into their decision.

On July 22, a Los Angeles Police Department commander directed sworn personnel to stop enforcing the states high-capacity magazine ban, which the Supreme Court vacated in light of Bruen. Until the case is decided, officers are not to investigate, detain, or arrest anyone suspected of possessing ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds unless they are a prohibited purchaser, the LAPD confirmed to The Trace.

**Delaware**

Delaware, a may-issue state, doesnt appear to have issued guidance on how Bruen will affect the states concealed carry permitting laws. But a week after the ruling, Governor John Carney signed legislation that bans assault weapons; raises the age for buying semiautomatic rifles to 21; caps magazine capacity at 17 rounds; creates an avenue to sue gun makers and sellers; bans machine gun conversion devices; and revives the states gun background check system.

**Maryland**

On July 5, Governor Larry Hogan directed the Maryland State Police to stop using a good and substantial reason standard when evaluating concealed carry permit applicants. In response, leaders in the Democrat-led state Legislature have vowed to pass new concealed carry restrictions. 

On July 12, the local council in Montgomery County, disappointed by Bruen, introduced a bill that would ban guns in or near places of public assembly. A couple of weeks later, the Montgomery County States Attorney said he would be dropping illegal gun carry charges against people who were denied a concealed carry permit because they didnt meet the good and substantial reason standard.

**Massachusetts**

On July 1, Attorney General Maura Healey said licensing authorities can no longer enforce the good reason provision of the states concealed carry law. Healey issued guidance that the suitability requirement was unaffected by Bruen.

Shortly after the ruling, police departments around the state began to lift restrictions on concealed carry permits that were limited to hunting or target shooting only. The change could affect nearly 20,000 gun owners. By mid-July, Boston had unrestricted nearly 250 such licenses, while Springfield had unrestricted 53. 

On August 1, the state legislature passed a measure that would amend concealed carry laws to comply with Bruen. It includes language that removes a reasonable exercise of discretion on the part of licensing authorities, eliminates a requirement that applicants have good reason to fear injury, and replaces the word may with shall in the state statute, reflecting the transition from may-issue to shall-issue. The bill also requires in-person interviews with licensing authorities and adds new categories of prohibited carriers, including people subject to temporary and permanent harassment prevention orders and people who have exhibited behavior that suggests they would be a danger to themselves or others. Republican Governor Charlie Baker is expected to sign the legislation.

**New Jersey**

On June 24, Acting Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin told prosecutors and law enforcement agencies that the states justifiable need requirement was no longer enforceable. Platkin emphasized that the ruling does not change any other aspect of New Jerseys public carry laws, which include comprehensive background checks, character references from three people youve known for at least three years, and firearms training. 

**New York** 

On July 1, Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, which imposes a number of regulations on the public carry of firearms, including: a ban on guns in sensitive locations like public transit, government buildings, places of worship, polling places, medical facilities, bars, and Times Square; a provision that automatically designates all private property to be a gun-free zone unless the property owner deems otherwise; 18 hours of required firearm training; and a requirement that applicants furnish a list of social media accounts as part of a background check investigation.

The striking of New Yorks proper cause requirement didnt remove limitations on permits limited to carrying a gun while hunting or during target practice. Right now its unclear if and how that will happen  authorities who issue pistol permits say theyre still awaiting guidance from the governor.

**Rhode Island**

On July 19, Attorney General Peter Neronha announced that the states unique dual permitting system  which provides two avenues for obtaining a carry permit, one may-issue and one shall-issue  is not affected by Bruen. Residents can still go to their local licensing authority and apply for a permit without a proper showing of need, or they can apply to the Attorney Generals Office, which does require a proper showing of need and uses discretion when issuing permits.


**GUN LAW CHALLENGES**

**California**

* Boland v. Bonta: On August 1, the California Rifle and Pistol Association filed suit to overturn the states 1999 Unsafe Handgun Act, which established safety standards for handguns. If a pistol is deemed unsafe, it cant be sold by licensed dealers. The plaintiffs argue that the regulation wouldnt pass the history-and-tradition test set forth in Bruen. At least two previous attempts to void the law have failed.

* Duncan v. Bonta: On June 30, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the states high-capacity magazine ban back to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the ban in November 2021. The case was brought by the California Rifle &amp; Pistol Association and a group of private citizens, who argue that the law is unconstitutional because it provides no exceptions for magazines owned before the law took effect, and thus violates a Fifth Amendment clause that protects against the confiscation of legally acquired property. They also argue that because the devices are widely owned, the ban conflicts with SCOTUSs ruling in 2008s District of Columbia v. Heller that weapons typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes are protected by the Second Amendment. In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs asked the courts to determine whether the two-step framework that lower courts used to decide gun cases  which took into account not just precedent, but also the public-safety ramifications of the law  is consistent with the Second Amendment. Since Bruen rewrote that framework, scuttling the consideration of modern-day factors, this question no longer applies. On August 2, the Ninth Circuit asked lawyers for both sides to submit supplemental briefs on how they believe Bruen affects the case.

* Martinez v. Villanueva: On July 6, Californias Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has sided with gun-rights groups in recent years, vacated a decision regarding pandemic-related gun store and shooting range closures in Los Angeles County and returned the case to a district court. A Ninth Circuit panel ruled in January that the closures burden the core of the Second Amendment right at a time of crisis, precisely when the need to exercise that right becomes most acute. The defendants, which include a slew of state officials, had requested that the case be remanded to the district court on the grounds that a similar case in nearby Ventura County was remanded in light of Bruen. The plaintiffs include the National Rifle Association, the Firearms Policy Coalition, the Second Amendment Foundation, and the California Gun Rights Foundation.

* Miller v. Bonta: On August 1, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a June 2021 ruling that struck down the states 30-year-old assault weapons ban, and sent the case back to a district court for reconsideration in light of Bruen. In the 2021 ruling, U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez, whos frequently sided with gun rights advocates, said AR-15s are like Swiss Army knives, a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment. The case will return to his courtroom.

* Rhode v. Bonta: On June 24, the Ninth Circuit asked the parties involved in an ongoing challenge to the states 2016 ammunition background check law to prepare supplemental briefs in light of Bruen. The case was brought in 2018 by the California Rifle &amp; Pistol Association and a group of ammunition retailers and private citizens, who argue that provisions that implement a vendor-licensing system and prohibit direct mail-order ammunition sales essentially ban millions of constitutionally protected ammunition transfers and heavily burden countless millions more. The law took effect in July 2019.

* Rupp v. Bonta: On June 28, the Ninth Circuit sent a 2017 challenge to the states assault weapons ban back to a district court for further proceedings consistent with the Bruen decision. The plaintiffs, which include the California Rifle &amp; Pistol Association and several private citizens, are arguing that semiautomatic rifles are in common use by millions of Americans for self-defense and thus protected by Heller. They also say the criteria that California uses to determine whether a gun is an assault weapon  features including pistol grips, adjustable stocks, and flash suppressors  have [nothing] to do with rate of fire, ammunition capacity, power, or anything else linked to the rifles potential to be exploited for crime.

**Colorado**

* Rocky Mountain Gun Owners v. Town of Superior: On July 7, two gun groups, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and the National Association for Gun Rights, joined a local resident in bringing a challenge to Superiors semiautomatic rifle ban, enacted a year after a mass shooting at a supermarket in nearby Boulder left 10 people dead. The plaintiffs argue that the ordinance contradicts the history-and-tradition framework that Bruen directed lower courts to apply to Second Amendment cases. On July 22, U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore, an appointee of Barack Obama, agreed, concluding that the plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success on the merits and issuing a temporary restraining order halting enforcement of the ordinance. More lawsuits could follow: The city councils in Boulder and Louisville approved assault weapon bans in June, and Boulder County is considering one.

* Gates v. Polis: On July 28, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and a group of private citizens filed suit in U.S. District Court to reverse the states 2013 ban on ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. The plaintiffs argue that the 2020 Colorado Supreme Court ruling that upheld the ban should be vacated and redecided according to the history-and-tradition test set forth in Bruen.

**Delaware**

* Delaware State Sportsmens Association v. Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security: On July 20, an NRA-backed consortium of local gun rights groups filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court challenging the states three-week-old law prohibiting sales of certain semiautomatic rifles. The plaintiffs, which include local gun groups and private citizens, argue that since Delawares assault weapons ban was inspired by Marylands, and the Supreme Court vacated a challenge to Marylands ban and sent it back to a lower court for reconsideration because of Bruen, Delawares ban should be voided.

**Florida**

* United States v. Matthew Raymond Hoover: On July 1, Hoover, a gun dealer and YouTuber who was charged in January with conspiring to illegally distribute machine gun conversion devices, asked a U.S. District Court in Florida to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the 1934 federal law regulating machine guns doesnt pass Bruens history-and-tradition test. Hoovers lawyers go even further, asking the judge to rule the National Firearms Act unconstitutional. They cite 88-year-old Senate testimony in which then-Attorney General Homer Stille Commings admitted that lawmakers enacted a tax on machine guns instead of an outright ban in order to dodge questions of constitutionality.

**Hawaii** 

* Young v. Hawaii: On June 30, the Supreme Court returned a challenge to the states open carry licensing scheme to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The lower court had upheld the ban in March 2021. The plaintiff, George Young, is seeking to eliminate the requirement that gun owners demonstrate the urgency or the need to obtain a permit to openly carry a gun for the purposes of the protection of life and property. Young applied for an open carry license in 2011 but authorities determined he didnt meet the urgency and need standard. The laws defenders argue that openly carrying firearms can incite violent behavior and intimidate members of the public, and make it harder for police to identify public safety threats.

**Illinois**

* Second Amendment Arms v. City of Chicago: On June 28, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Dow Jr. asked lawyers involved in a challenge to Chicagos 2010 ban on gun laser sights to offer arguments on how Bruen impacts the case. The court is particularly interested in whether the parties believe that the Supreme Courts framework impacts the analysis and/or result, he wrote. The laser sight ban is the last remaining issue in a case that was brought by a gun dealer in 2010.

**Maryland**

* Bianchi v. Frosh: On June 30, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the states assault weapons ban back down to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in light of Bruens new methodology. The Fourth Circuit upheld the ban in 2017, ruling that semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines were dangerous and unusual weapons and not protected by the Second Amendment under the standards set forth by Heller. The plaintiffs argue that semiautomatic rifles like AR-15s are in common use and thus protected by the Second Amendment. There is no text, history, tradition of banning these certain types of rifles, said Mark W. Pennak, the president of the gun group Maryland Shall Issue, one of the plaintiffs in the unsuccessful 2017 challenge to the ban.

* Prince Georges County, Maryland - A public defender successfully used Bruen to get illegal gun possession charges dismissed on the grounds that the state law criminalizing carrying a handgun without a permit is now unconstitutional. Another attempt, by a public defender in Baltimore who argued that there is no sufficient historical tradition of banning firearm possession by drug felons failed.

**New Jersey**

* New Jersey Rifle &amp; Pistol Clubs v. Bruck: On June 30, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the states ban on high-capacity magazines back to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the law in 2020. The plaintiff, a member of the Association of New Jersey Rifle &amp; Pistol Clubs, is arguing that the 2018 ban is unconstitutional because it provides no exceptions for magazines owned before the law took effect, and thus violates a Fifth Amendment clause that protects against the confiscation of legally acquired property. They also argue that the devices are widely owned, and conflict with Hellers ruling that weapons typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes are protected by the Second Amendment. The laws defenders say that limiting the number of rounds in a magazine can save lives, as gunmen must stop to reload, providing opportunities for bystanders to intervene. Several mass shooters and would-be mass shooters have been stopped this way. 

**New York**

* Antonyuk v. Bruen, brought by Gun Owners of America, seeks to strike the requirement that concealed carry applicants furnish a list of their social media accounts as part of their background check. The suit also takes issue with the good moral character requirement, calling it a standardless notion that contradicts Bruens ruling that authorities shouldnt be granted the discretion to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or suitability. The plaintiffs also want to eliminate a longstanding requirement that applicants supply at least four character references. 

* Corbett v. Hochul is also challenging the social media requirement, as well as new training requirements that mandate 18 hours of firearms instruction.

* Paladino v. Bruen seeks to strike the part of the law that designates private property a gun-free zone by default.

* Lewis v. James, filed on July 8, seeks to overturn the states 2013 assault weapons ban based on the history-and-tradition test.

* Vanchoff V. James, filed on July 12 by the Firearms Policy Coalition, also seeks to overturn the states assault weapons ban based on the history-and-tradition framework.

**New York City** 

* Public defenders have been asking judges to dismiss gun possession charges on the assertion that Bruen renders the states 121-year-old gun permit statute unconstitutional. The tactic has been used in at least seven cases, four of which were unsuccessful. In rejecting the argument, a Manhattan Supreme Court judge wrote that failing to seek a license before roaming the streets with a loaded firearm is not abiding by the law, and nothing in the Second Amendment requires that it be tolerated. The Constitution is not a suicide pact. For its part, the Legal Aid Society says that lawmakers should focus on real solutions to gun violence, which lie outside of the criminal legal system.

**Washington, D.C.**

* Angelo v. District of Columbia: On June 30, four licensed concealed carriers in Washington, D.C., filed suit in U.S. District Court to overturn the gun ban on the districts transit system. The plaintiffs argue that the ban wont pass Bruens history-and-tradition test.",selftext,/r/progun/comments/wi7zax/comprehensive_list_of_gun_law_changes_and/,progun

This is always a fear here too on /r/progun to be clear, and we've tried to share real world info to protect against this. In light of the new information leaking out on how we might be classified/identified by the feds, even if we have no ill intent today, tomorrow, or in the future, I just wanted to get the facts out there.

Here's what was stumbled upon:  
~20 days ago, the top mod at /r/gunpolitics user /u/AceOfBlack stopped posting after years of posting daily. Then user /u/mark-five a dormant 9 year old account, all of a sudden started posting with nearly the same interests as AceOfBlack, with nearly the same frequency, if not greater. For obvious examples: Stonk/WSB, television, guns, etc. AceOfBlack is either the same person as Mark-Five, or it's meant to look that way. They accidentally revealed this tonight by using the AceOfBase account to control bad information (shared seemingly to get gun owners charged for possessing FRTs) that Mark-Five was posting on gunpolitics. Equally weird, they asked for new mods just yesterday, which seems to be a setup to add alts or accounts controlled by others/non-progun users.

Devil's advocate, the angle on the thread I participated in *could* be trying to bring more cases on FRTs to get them eventually ruled legal by the courts, but that's a huge stretch and at the expense of other innocent people in our community. To all of sudden, after 8+ years of waiting, have a top mod of one of the largest progun subreddits switch to a random alt, go dark on their main account, and use it to suppress progun conversation is worrisome. And then to be trying to add mods (in a locked post) to such an important sub...just too many flags.

I fucking **hate** the implications of this. As all too many of you know, I am super hesitant to call anything conspiracy/false flag/etc, but wanted to share. If I'm missing details or facts (which I feel/hope I must be,) please comment. I will happily edit this post to add them.",selftext,/r/progun/comments/whe0h7/gun_subredditsmods_being_compromised_found_one/,progun

My dog (Kevin) and I go to the same park every day to play fetch. The park is just down the block from our house, its practically next door. Kevin is a 2 year old Doberman Pinscher and is extremely well trained. He has an exception under our HOA to walk without a leash because hes a service animal because im deaf in my left ear. Being security minded, he is also trained in basic defense. I routinely send Kevin to the park with my son to keep him and the kids safe. I also carry a firearm every day and today was no exception.

I threw the ball for Kevin and this other dog comes out of nowhere and jumps on Kevin. This other dog was some kind of pitbull mix and had latched onto Kevins neck. Kevin gets the dog off him and I recall him immediately. The other dog runs after him and Kevin goes into defensive mode like a good boy. As the dogs are barking and Kevin is protecting, I pull my weapon. Just as it clears my holster, the dog goes after my leg. The dog is about five yards away and I give Kevin the between command (this has him back between my legs) and I put one round into the dog. 

I holster and carry (hes 100 lbs) Kevin back home and put him in the car. Hes bleeding everywhere and we rush to the doggy ER. He got 30 stitches and is expected to make a full recovery.

I just got done speaking with the police and filed a report. They did take my firearm and I signed the correct form for it not to be destroyed.

The two main ways that I see this are
1) using the term assault weapon/ assault rifle. This term was developed in the 1980s to intentionally mislead the American public. Gun Prohibitionists concluded that Americans for the most part couldnt tell the difference between semi auto and fully auto firearms if they looked the same. A man by the name of sugarmann concluded that this ignorance could be exploited to mislead the public and benefit the gun Prohibitionist movement. They have been doing this ever since. If you wonder why people have been saying why cant these gun grabbers tell the difference after years of explaining the difference ad nauseum? This is why. They do not benefit from it. They benefit from misleading. Many absolutely do understand but they continue to make intellectually dishonest arguments while pretending to play dumb. Stop playing this game with them. Stop telling them that assault weapons are actually military weapons. Just discontinue and delete this term from your vocabulary. When they use it correct them until they stop using it. Use the term semi automatic firearm. So long as we continue to adopt their terminology we are helping to advance their tactics whether we mean to or not. 
2)why do you need ____ to go hunting?
We all know the second amendment is not related to hunting. The reason gun prohibitionists constantly use this is because they are using a tactic known as framing. They are setting the parameters in which a discussion will occur to give themselves an inherent advantage in a debate. This gives them two benefits i) it requires you to abandon the legitimacy of using a semi auto firearm for self defense by asking you to show why you need it for a purpose they chose that isnt really a need. You need to defend yourself and your loved ones. You dont need to hunt. ii) This also asks you to abandon the legitimacy of resistance to the formation of a totalitarian state. When asked why____ is needed for hunting tell them that the point is not primarily for hunting, but defense in todays environment and part of a means to resist tyranny. These are legitimate purposes.

1) Always bring a gun, whenever you can, to gunfights. It works better that way.

2)Unless the store owner is actually a lefty he clearly did some off-hand practice. From the video he is firing left-handed. Moral: Practice operating(not just firing) from your non-dominant side, because you never know what your firing position might be or, you might take a wound to your dominant side (hand, arm, whatever).

3)The store owner (probably completely accidentally) had pretty good concealment. That said there is a difference, a VERY important difference between concealment and cover. Learn it and know it!

The Bad

The store owner waited too long to engage, the robber had a shot at him, he just didn't take it. Best to have engaged whilst the enemy still had some entanglement with the door. There's no way he didn't have some entanglement with the door even if he kicked it open, which put him at a disadvantage.

I explained what guns can do and helped her make the connection to WHY you always keep your finger off the trigger and point in a safe direction. After that I proceeded to answer her questions about how they work. She was quite curious about CASINGS of all things. Turns out, the casings are always what caught her eye in movies and games. So I showed her a round of 9mm explaining how they loaded into a magazine, then into a pistol. I explained that once the round was fired the bullet came out the end, and the casing was ejected (had to stop to explain that word).

I keep seeing many many people say they are fully for the second amendment, their responsibility to uphold it, and willing to die for their freedom and rights. 
And the truth is, If you believe in dying for something, you're probably going to. 
Let it be clear, the ATF has illegally collected most of your personal information.
The ATF and local law enforcement agencies have already conducted many red flag searches that have ended in death of someone exercising their right.   
Our representatives regularly betray their constitutional oath and fail to represent their constituents. 
I am not trying to fear monger or encourage any violent acts, but the time already came and passed for a change in a more freedom loving direction, not just for guns, but humanity and all natural rights of the people.
No one has done anything directly, for the same reason you don't think about those in a third world country every day, it's far away, and although real, not a current threat to you (yet) or your loved ones.  
Don't forget it really does exist, it's not the usual boogyman hype, and has already happened in other countries very recently, aggressively, and quickly.
Again, i see people willing to die for their rights and beliefs, but who is willing to kill, and go first.   
The moral authority we carry not to kill, and to reason, is how we have gotten here, led by men and women uneducated on the subject, it's direct impact on us, and the course it sets for our future. This inaction and reasoning Has cost us more than violent action at the beginning would have as a whole.  And our representatives continue to ignore the people, choosing to lobby (get paid).
We made the mistake of vocalizing our position and not standing our ground, ground we have and continue to lose.   The issue is sacrificing not yourself, but your family and friends wellbeing by not being there, the worry that you'll have made a mistake, and that life is too precious to truly be willing to give it up. So stop being passive, and willing to die.  Vocalize your willing to kill, as much as die, because your private information has probably already been recorded, and the more people they have to investigate, the more resources they use.   You can't be arrested for expressing yourself. Eventually, instead of seeing a bunch of people willing to die, they're going to see a bunch of people willing to kill.  And that may be a better message. Would you fear 1,000,000 people willing to die, or 1,000,000 people ready to kill.  If you live in a red flag state perhaps don't participate, but don't just keep saying you're upset, and ready to give up.  Willing to die is willing to give up.  Willing to kill is willing to fight.

For example, in May 2022, a ghost-gun obsessed man, Edison Cruz, allegedly used a ghost gun to kill a man on a Bronx street, and injure two bystanders, after a confrontation in a fast-food restaurant. **Cruz had a lengthy criminal  history, including multiple prior arrests for possessing ghost guns that he ordered online. These arrests included one while he was subject to an order of protection obtained by his parents which prohibited him from possessing any firearms, and another after he was found walking through the Bronx with a bulletproof vest and a grenade launcher. A search of his Bronx home revealed two unfinished handgun frames, and tools and parts to assemble them.** There is evidence that Cruz made at least two online purchases from Defendant 80P Builders in 2021.  

So reading this paragraph above where they detail his crimes...how was he not in jail?  Well, NYC doesn't want to lock up people is why.  Guy had a damn grenade launcher walking down the street in NYC, ghost guns in his apartment, all 3 of his arrests they found illegal guns, yet he was free to walk the streets and kill people.  I hope the companies that are defending point this out!.",selftext,/r/progun/comments/w7rv2c/nyc_has_some_balls_they_sued_gun_manufacturers/,progun

The 911 caller is a single mother with 2 kids under the age of 5 living across the hall from a guy who has been ""stalking"" her.  He starts shooting in his apartment and at least 1 round goes through her apartment spraying her with shrapnel.

I understand the operator's point - you don't want to be waving guns around when the officers respond. But how could anyone fault her for having a gun for protection - and she has done so legally.

Without going into the abortion topic too much (its discussed at length everywhere), every abortion ends in a death. Not nearly every gun ends up killing someone. Very few comparatively do. 

Regarding assisted suicide though, many gun controllers will claim restricting guns will mean less suicides after being reminded that nearly 60% of firearm deaths are indeed self-inflicted. 

Heres my take: if you want to reduce suicides via gun control, you cant logically (I know, I know) support assisted suicides as well. If anything, a gun would result in a more immediate outcome. I support neither gun control nor assisted suicide, but its hard for me to reconcile when someone thinks one should be able to kill themselves with medicine but we need to reduce GUN suicides.

With all of the headlines of shootings recently, it's really got him to move far more left and he thinks that conservatives are heartless in the sense of they want to hold onto their guns for hobbies like hunting and completely dismiss all of the negative side effects that come with every citizen having the opportunity of possessing a firearm.

While I think mass shootings are horrific, I also don't think banning guns would stop them. We already have more guns than people in this country and the people that decide to participate in the buyback program are most likely law-abiding citizens. So that would potentially open the door for criminals to hide their firearms or purchase on black markets and for officers of the law to be more threatening, leaving the law-abiding citizens unequipped for any self-defense scenario.

Since my friend believes that guns make this country one of the scariest places on Earth, I decided to look up the stats on homicide rates per capita by country. This list doesn't even have the US ranking in the Top 50 most homicides per capita. Am I reading these stats correctly? Is it fair to say that our homicide rate is surprisingly low for being the most pro-gun country to exist in the modern world. Would love your feedback.

I posted elsewhere previously but was met with hostility, so I just want to ask opinions - Im not saying ban all guns for the record. I just want thoughts. 



Hi there. 

How can you justify keeping guns?

America is living proof that allowing the population to keep firearms is a severely negative thing. 

Between January and May 2021 there were 128 mass shootings. Nearly all of which were caused by people with legally owned guns. For context, England has had 3 in 30 years. And they learned from their mistake - they changed gun laws after mass shootings where people were seriously hurt. Australia also learnt from mistakes and banned guns after deadly shootings. Also, dont claim america has more shootings due to a larger population - England has a population of about 64 million. America has one of 310 million approx. So nearly 5 times as large, yet has over 128 times as many shootings (between January and May 2021). America cannot deny there is a large gun problem. 

America has often claimed they keep their guns to take on an oppressive government. Bullshit. There have been many government suppressing other rights - the right to free speech, abortion etc etc. Not ONCE was this well regulated militia brave enough to use their guns and put the government in check. 

Speaking of a well regulated militia - thats what it should be. Its what the second amendment states. The entire population having guns is NOT a well regulated militia. Also, Washington said (and it is in the constitution) that the ENTIRE constitution should be rewritten every 17 years. If that had happened the second amendment would be very different or all together gone once government realised how powerful guns were getting and how they were unsafe, so dont argue that the founding fathers wanted it to be this way. 

Firearms are now the number one cause of death for children in the United States. If that doesnt prove guns are not being used for good I dont know what does. 

Im not saying outright ban guns but maybe take after other countries - Germany for example. Where guns are legal but there are much heavier restrictions ( watch [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMN9raUJV/?k=1) - I feel it is very interesting and thought provoking). 

So, please be civil and spark discussion. Why shouldnt the US change their gun laws? I am genuinely just curious to your thoughts on this matter.

A New Report Casts Doubt on the Assumption That Gun Law Violators Are a Public Menace

The vast majority of federal firearm offenses involve illegal possession, often without aggravating conduct or a history of violence.

Jacob Sullum | 7.15.2022 2:35 PM 

A new report on federal firearm offenses shows that the vast majority involve illegal possession, often without aggravating circumstances or a history of violence. The data undermine the assumption that people who violate gun laws are predatory criminals who pose a serious threat to public safety. They also highlight the racially disproportionate impact of such laws, which is especially troubling given their excessive breadth.

In FY 2021, the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) reports, 89 percent of federal firearm offenders were legally disqualified from owning guns, typically because of a felony record. Half of those cases involved ""aggravating criminal conduct."" But in the other half, the defendant's ""status as a prohibited person solely formed the basis of the conviction.""

The aggravating conduct, which triggered sentencing enhancements under the USSC's guidelines, covered a wide range.

In 11 percent of the cases involving aggravating conduct, ""an offender or co-participant discharged a firearm."" In 4 percent of the cases where a gun was fired, someone was killed; someone was injured in 18 percent of those cases.

Some cases involved a stolen gun, a gun with an ""altered or obliterated serial number,"" or a prohibited weapon, such as a  machine gun or a sawed-off shotgun. Some defendants were engaged in gun trafficking. In more than a quarter of the cases, ""the firearm facilitated, or had the potential to facilitate, another felony offense (most commonly drug trafficking)."" That last category would include drug dealers who never threatened or injured anyone but kept or carried guns for self-defense.

As you would expect, aggravating factors resulted in relatively long prison sentences. The average was 55 months for cases involving stolen firearms or guns with altered serial numbers, 58 months in cases involving a prohibited weapon, 62 months in cases involving gun trafficking, and 119 monthsnearly 10 yearsin cases involving ""the use of, or conspiracy to use, a firearm in connection with a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime."" In other words, the combination of drug possession and gun possession can be enough to put someone behind bars for a decade, which starkly illustrates the interaction between those two kinds of prohibitions.

In half of the cases involving ""prohibited persons,"" the defendant ""did not engage in additional aggravating conduct."" The average sentence for such defendants was about three years. Even in those cases, you might surmise, the defendants' prior criminal records probably indicated violent tendencies that justified sending them to prison for possessing a gun. But that is not necessarily true.

Overall, 61 percent of firearm offenders had been convicted of violent crimes. Assault was the most common offense, accounting for 49.4 percent of prior convictions. Robbery was the next most common offense (19.9 percent), followed by ""other violent"" crimes (14.8 percent), homicide (3.8 percent), and rape (3.3 percent).

Many of these defendants surely posed a continuing threat to public safety. But the federal prohibition of gun possession by people with felony records (technically, people convicted of crimes punishable by more than a year of incarceration) is a lifetime ban except in rare cases where people manage to have their Second Amendment rights restored.

That policy, which threatens violators with up to 10 years in prison, is hard to justify unless you assume that people convicted of violent crimes cannot be rehabilitated and do not change their ways as they mature. That assumption does not seem reasonable in light of research indicating that recidivism declines sharply with age. Yet federal law is based on the premise that, say, a man convicted of assault in his early 20s can never be trusted with a gun, even if he stays out of trouble for decades. Because of that youthful crime, he forever loses the right to armed self-defense.

Furthermore, the USSC's numbers indicate that two-fifths of firearm offenders had never been convicted of a violent crime. Many prior convictions involved drug trafficking (31.6 percent) or previous weapon offenses (44.2 percent). Five percent of the defendants were disqualified from owning a gun because they were illegal drug users. If a decades-old assault conviction seems like a thin pretext for permanently depriving someone of his constitutional rights, a decades-old drug conviction, involving conduct that violated no one's rights, seems even thinner.

The irrationality and injustice of this policy look even worse when you consider the demographics of federal firearm offenders. In FY 2021, 55 percent of them were black. A similar racial disparity is apparent at the state level. According to FBI data, African Americans, who represent about 14 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 42 percent of arrests for weapon offenses in 2019.

Such disparities are not surprising, because black people are especially likely to have felony records. A 2017 study by University of Georgia sociologist Sarah Shannon found that 33 percent of male African Americans had been convicted of a felony, compared to 8 percent of the general population. The upshot is that the burdens of excessively broad restrictions on gun ownership are concentrated in that segment of the population.

If those restrictions made sense, you might dismiss the disparities, citing cross-racial differences in crime rates. But those restrictions do not make sense, since they apply to millions of people who either are not currently dangerous or never were.",selftext,/r/progun/comments/w0vtj4/a_new_report_casts_doubt_on_the_assumption_that/,progun

&gt; 31.1% of all gun owners who took the survey said that they had used their firearm in self defense at least once even if it was not fired or displayed (not including law enforcement, security, or military service). In addition, the majority of those answering in the affirmative had used their gun more than once in self defense. Extrapolating this 31.1% data out would mean that roughly 25.3 million adults have used a firearm to stop a crime or protect themselves at least once in their life.

Credit to u/whyamiherewhatislife for the above info that prompted me to share my story below.

Here's my ""not fired or displayed"" true story:

Crazy dude (distant neighbor) has beef with my neighbor that shares our driveway. According to my neighbor I know to be a reliable and sane individual, crazy guy has been talking about killing his wife, threatened him with a shotgun the week prior and a bat the day before, and is convinced that I am an undercover agent for ""The Global Police"" tasked with surveiling him (crazy guy)...

We're both standing outside one morning talking when we see crazy guy driving by. He slams on the brakes, throws it in reverse, then comes hauling ass into our driveway screaming unintelligibly as he does. I can clearly see a bat on his dashboard. We both beat feet into our cabins and I hear neighbor's door close just after mine. I grab my loaded pistol, which I had sitting on top of my fridge (no kids in the house), having been warned of my involvement in crazy Guy's delusions by my neighbor earlier that morning. As I grab it I realize I didn't lock the door I just came through. Too late, I think to myself as I draw a bead on the entryway with my weapon in one hand and dial 911 with my other while taking cover behind my kitchen counter.

Given the circumstances leading up to this unprovoked encounter, my knowledge that crazy guy is armed and has threatened at least one person with a firearm, and that I feared he intended to kill or seriously harm either me, my neighbor, or both of us I had already decided that if crazy guy walked through that door I would shoot him to protect myself. Where I lived at the time I would have been 100% legally justified if I did, and I had no reservations about doing so. Plain and simple, if he entered I was going to drop him with several rounds of 45 caliber hollowpoint and he would likely bleed out and die on my kitchen floor.

Fast forward a few minutes and crazy guy has left and peace officers are in route. I take a deep breath and tuck my pistol into my belt then walk outside to let my neighbor know cops were coming. Almost 30 minutes later they finally arrive and take our statements before heading over to crazy Guy's place. Since he did not commit any felonies there wasn't anything they could do to take him into custody, but they do have a long history with the guy. They advise him there's a very good chance that I will shoot him onsite (not entirely true but close enough) if he returns to trespass on my property again and to refrain from contact of any type with either me or my neighbor.

We did not have any further issues with crazy guy after that day's encounter.",selftext,/r/progun/comments/w0hr1r/til_31_of_gun_owners_have_used_a_firearm_for_self/,progun

Bruen in August, seeking to block the legislation.** In response to the lawsuit, Bruens lawyers argued in a court filing that the CCIAs good moral character standard is deeply rooted in Anglo-American legal tradition and should therefore be upheld by the court.

From the early days of English settlement in America, the colonies sought to prevent Native American tribes from acquiring firearms, passing laws forbidding the sale and trading of arms to Indigenous people, the filing reads.

*Bruens lawyers also note that Catholics were barred from owning firearms, both in England and in colonial America, due to their suspected disloyalty.*

**It proves what GOA has been saying for decades, which is that the origin of gun control is racist,** Aidan Johnston, GOAs director of federal affairs, told the Daily Caller. Gun laws come from a majority trying to suppress or dominate or control a minority, whether it be a minority of Catholics in early America, or a minority of Native Americans when theres colonials trying to take over the continent.

In a response to Bruens filing, GOA released a brief Monday detailing ways in which good moral character laws were used to restrict both First and Second Amendment rights from minorities.

Georgias 1840s slave codes, much like the CCIA, prohibited the exercise of First Amendment rights without government licensure, prohibiting any person of color from being allowed to preach or exhort without written license, one of the qualifications of which was proof of the good moral character of the applicant,' GOA wrote in their response to the filing.

**Were pointing out that slave codes  are also the historical basis for denying people their right to carry a firearm on good moral character, obviously in an attempt to show that the root of this requirement is racist and unconstitutional and should be struck down, Johnston told the Caller.**.",comment,/r/progun/comments/wvx4lq/goa_and_ny_agree_in_lawsuit_the_historical_basis/ilhryjb/,progun

&gt;the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militiacivilians primarily, soldiers on occasion

So it was acknowledged that civilians were the primary make up of the militia. 

&gt;These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.'

More confirmation that militia implied civilians. Eben the well regulated meant ""enrolled for military discipline""

&gt;In all the colonies, as in England, the militia system was based on the principle of the assize of arms. This implied the general obligation of all adult male inhabitants to possess arms, and, with certain exceptions, to cooperate in the work of defence.'

Thr militia is all adult men. Hmm...

&gt;The General Court of Massachusetts, January Session 1784 (Laws and Resolves 1784, c. 55, pp. 140, 142), provided for the organization and government of the Militia. It directed that the Train Band should 'contain all able bodied men, from sixteen to forty years of age

And here we have a reference to an even older ruling that acknowledged the militia is all men 16 to 40.

&gt;By an Act passed April 4, 1786 (Laws 1786, c. 25), the New York Legislature directed: 'That every able-bodied Male Person, being a Citizen of this State, or of any of the United States, and residing in this State, (except such Persons as are herein after excepted) and who are of the Age of Sixteen, and under the Age of Forty-five Years

And again, all men. This time 16 to 45.

While Miller did not explicitly say it belongs to the people, it went a very long way to say the right exists to all adult men. It really should be noted, Miller was also argued in a vacuum (only the government made oral arguments) was carefully written in a way that it upheld the NFA without explicitly showing they were ignoring the 2nd.

The Militia - What They Said.

James Madison: The ultimate authority  resides in the people alone.  The advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation  forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition. Federalist 46

Rep. Tenche Coxe of Pennsylvania: Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birthright of an American The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.  Tenche Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

Patrick Henry: The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun. 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.

Thomas Jefferson: No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms., Proposal for a Virginia Constitution, 1 T. Jefferson Papers, 334 (C.J. Boyd, Ed. 1950)

George Mason: I ask you sir, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people. (Elliott, Debates, 425-426)

Richard Henry Lee: To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them Richard Henry (LIGHT HORSE HARRY) Lee, writing in Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republic (1787-1788)

Justice Joseph Story: The militia is the natural defence of a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domestic insurrections and domestic usurpations of power by rulers. It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace both from the enormous expenses with which they are attended and the facile means which they afford to ambitious and unprincipled rulers to subvert the government or trample upon the rights of the people. The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as the palladium of the liberties of a republic since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally even if these are successful the first instance enable the people to resist and triumph over them Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States. 3 vols. Boston, 1833. 

Also, multiple state constitutions spell this out... all other rights in the constitution/bill of rights are rights of individuals... no reason to think 2A is any different.

Further, there is also no argument to if the right to keep and bear arms (innate and God-Given as it is the fundamental right to self-defense) refers to individuals or organized milita. This was long resolved in D.C. v. Heller, strengthened by McDonald v. Chicago and even more by NYSRPA v. Bruen. This long overturned the dictum in the ancient and somewhat fraudulent case of U.S. v.

There really wasnt any distinction between private gun owners and militia members in the colonies. Free men owned weapons, and free men formed militias at the request of the governor or as some other local emergency dictated (I.e. Indian raids). As the war became truly an American rebellion rather than a regional uprising, the Continental Army appointed by Congress was notoriously under supplied. Many of the men needed weapons, among several other things, because the ones they initially brought were lost, destroyed, or captured. Some others had come without arms hoping they could serve the cause in some other way such as artillery (which was also in short supply). So when the French and other European powers began secretly and openly supporting the Americans, many of the weapons were technically the property of the US government, but once they were dispersed among the Continental soldiers as well as the volunteer militias, they effectively became the property of the soldier.

Case in point, like I said before: what if it's factually true that no previous court case recognized the 2A as an individual right?  Does that change the argument in any meaningful way?  If you are challenged on this point and unable to point to a specific case from history, are you expected to slink away in defeat?

The facts of these situations are rarely as simple as a quick refutation in a Reddit post.  On the factual side of things: if you limit your scope to SCOTUS, then the only thing you have to go on is Miller, in 1939.  That was the most recent core 2A case until Heller, 70 years later.  There was a single statement in the Miller ruling to the effect that Congress can regulate sawed-off shotguns because they have no ""reasonable relationship to a well-regulated militia.""  I'm not sure if I have the words exactly right but that was the gist of it, and this is the statement that the antis are usually referring to when they say SCOTUS has affirmed the 2A as a collective right.

There are a number of problems with this.  First off, the statement may be interpreted by some to mean that the 2A is a collective right (state-organized militia), but even if we grant that as true (a stretch by any reckoning), it by no means excludes the 2A as ALSO being an individual right.  The 2A prefatory clause (a well-armed militia) states one possible reason but does not place limitations on the operative clause (the right of the people), any more than the freedom of the press is limited only to those holding a government-issued press badge.

There are technical issues as well... in Miller, the court saw sawed-off shotguns as subject to regulation under the NFA because they did not see them as appropriate weapons for use in wartime.  This is factually incorrect, as any WWI infantryman with a sawed-off Winchester 1897 trench gun will tell you, but it goes further than that.  THESE days the antis are all about removing ""weapons of war"" from our streets, but SCOTUS in Miller said that the guns in question could be regulated because they were NOT weapons of war!  So, which is it??  

This is ideological, anti-gun cherry-picking at its finest.  They want to use one convenient part of an 80 year old ruling to support one of their positions, while totally ignoring another part of THE SAME RULING that they don't like.

All this sets aside the political events surrounding Miller, such as the anti-gun judge ruling against the state on purpose in order to force a SCOTUS appeal, knowing full well that Miller himself, a convicted thief, didn't have the money and wouldn't show up to defend his position.  It was a purposeful anti-2A slam dunk.  But again, that's beside the point.

The only mechanism which can deprecate a constitutional right, is a constitutional amendment. Even if 2A were conditional on militia participation (which it's not), for the NG existence to negate the people's 2A right the Constitution would still  need to be amended. The Constitution itself is supreme; and because of that, nothing about it, not its meaning, not the applicability of any conditional logic (if any) in it, nothing; nothing about it can be changed without an amendment. Anything else is the tail wagging the dog and is both logically and legally invalid on its face. Even if 2A were conditional logic ('if militia, then gun rights = yes'), you still cannot change the supreme rule (Constitution) by subsequently  mutating the meaning of 'militia' by saying it's now the National Guard. Even if it took a predicate element to declare the right, the predicate cannot be changed by statute or court ruling. Not even the Supreme Court can change the Constitution.  The SC can rule on what it means, but the only way to change it, is via Amendment. Thus, even if 'militia' were required (it's not) then the original meaning of 'militia' would still apply, which is that all 'able bodied American men [adults]' are automatically in the militia. Which means, as an adult USA citizen, if you're not feeble, you are in the militia. Therefore, even if 2A were conditional, the predicate is still valid and thus, the individual right would still be valid.",comment,/r/progun/comments/wvax3q/were_the_weapons_used_by_the_americans_in_the/ilg22ec/,progun

Because of that, interpreting the Second Amendment wasnt really something that came up much.

Theres a kind of deification involved with the Constitution and the BOR, but we should be careful because that sort of reverence for the BOR wasnt always with us. Mostly because the guarantor of an individuals rights were through State law and the State Constitutions.

For example, prior to Mapp v. Ohio, the Fourth Amendment only applied to Federal agents enforcing Federal law. State agents did not abide that. Whatever individual protections there were against unreasonable searches and seizures or other rights protected in the BOR had to come from a State Constitution or State statute. 

Prior to this, it would have been inane to claim in a lawsuit that State law enforcement violated your 2A or 4A rights, because those were restrictions only for Federal agents. This is not to say that the States didnt have similar rights enshrined in their Constitutions, because they did and still do. 

However, many States were taking care to enshrine the right to keep and bear arms and such provisions existed in State Constitutions in 1787.

All in all, what exactly the 2A meant at the time is somewhat of a bad question because State governments simply werent bound by it. So, the limitations on States regarding firearms bans and regulations is still a pretty new question.

Okay. The question we should answer as gun folks is why should the 2A apply to the States now when it wasnt made as a restriction on the States? My answer is because weve already incorporated the rest of the BOR (with only a few exceptions). If the 1A which explicitly says Congress shall make no and were comfortable applying that to State actors, then we should be equally comfortable with doing it for the 2A. 

The drastic change in the relationship of the States to the Federal Government since 1787 needs to be acknowledged because it was completely altered twice (following the Civil War and during the Depression and WWII).",comment,/r/progun/comments/wvdox0/2008_heller_decision_argument/ilfguue/,progun

What matters is 

the milia has two parts organized and unorganized.

Milita refers to the people, regardless of military service.

""the people"" refers to the citizenry. 

So the second amendment is about the people's right to own and bare arms. In order to operate a milita indepent of the state, or federal governments. 

Scotus has  ruled the government can not ban a family of firearms, that still has merit in a military or milita organization. And the government can not ban a firearm that is in common use for lawful purposes.

There is no debate. It is clearly laid out in plain English. The people who say the 2nd refers to the government/militas are completely incorrect. Think about it, what other right protections apply to the government/militias. The correct answer is none. As it is human rights not government rights.

But honest answer is both. Much of the weaponry was also provided by foreign powers, such as France and Spain, who had an interest in seeing England lose.

The Supreme Court clarified definitively some 15 years ago that the right to keep and bear arms is an *individual* right.

In the colonial era, the vast, vast,  vast majority of arms belonged to private individuals ... with individuals posessing anything from a sword to a musket to a cannon.  Yes, a cannon.  In some cases, well-off individuals would purchase a cannon  for the use of a militia.   Some folks  owned their own, and kept it.  in other cases, the community would raise funds for the purchase of a cannon - direct community action, no government procurement.

The Continental Congress was hard pressed to raise any funds for the Continental Army, and the individual colonies (or towns/counties wihtin a colony) supported their militias.  At the beginning of the Revolution, the army and militias both relied on soldiers to bring weapons from home.  As the war progressed, hundreds of thousands of arms were purchased (or donated) from France and Spain.

After the war, militias once again became primarily armed by individuals.  The standing army shrank greatly ... before 1812, the army was only about 7000 men total.  And in December 1860, the army was only about 16,000 troops. 

But all that is a distraction from the central question in your  post.  The right to keep and bear arms - as a matter of law and Constitution - is an *individual* right.

He likes hearing himself talk, and saying things that will make the people he is in the room with happy... 

I'm not here pretending that Trump was a friend to gun owners.   But when it comes to gun rights he was better then the alternative that was either Biden or Clinton.    Case point is the Supreme Court Justices that he nominated.   

I don't think Trump really cares about guns, he lived most of his life in New York City, probably being protected by guns, but not really needing one himself.  His kids interest in them probably swayed him a little bit, but mostly he pretended to care about them to gain votes from Gun Owners.  

Having said all of that-  I don't know the last Republican President who I would really call Pro-Gun.

\-George W Bush said he would sign the Assault Weapons Ban Renewal if congress put on his desk.   

\-George H.W. Bush put in place the ban on importation of foreign rifles that didn't have a ""sporting purpose"" I.E. He banned the importation of ""Assault Weapons"".  That is why so many guns have to be imported as parts kits and then manufactured with a certain amount of US Components.   He also supported the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban , even though it was put into place after his Presidency.

\-Reagan-  FOPA was really a mixed bag- it actually did a lot of good things for gun owners and FFL's- Like opened up the shipping of ammo to your home, or purchasing guns in other states.  And also banned the government from creating a gun registry.    But then there was the Hughes amendment which closed the machine gun registry.        If FOPA was the extent of Reagan's anti-gun policies he could possibly be forgiven because FOPA did so many other great things for Gun Owners.      But it isn't.    I'm sure we are all aware of the Mulford Act- which he signed as California Governor.    But his most egregious  actions came after his Presidency where he lobbied Republicans in congress to vote for the Brady Act, and also the Assault Weapons Bans.  

\-Gerald Ford-  He tried to get a nationwide ban on Saturday Night Specials-  although my understanding is, it wasn't something he pushed really hard for, and he rejected many tougher gun control policies.  

\-Lyndon B Johnson- signed the gun control act of 1968.

\-You have to go all the way back to Eisenhower to find a Republican President who who didn't enact or push for more gun control.",comment,/r/progun/comments/wufckw/biden_administration_continues_aggressive/ilbg915/,progun

I know we love to crap on the Ninth Circuit, but this is not true. Please stop spreading this false factoid. Quoting myself:

&gt; Because this stat and similar, less-accurate stats (read: fuddlore) get brought up from time to time, this particular number is compiled from [SCOTUSblog](https://www.scotusblog.com/)'s ""circuit scorecards"" for each term. This specific figure of 79% of Ninth Circuit decisions reversed since 2007 is accurate, not counting the current October 2021 term. SCOTUSblog publishes [statistics for each term](https://www.scotusblog.com/reference/stat-pack/); since 2007, these have included an easy to read scorecard which totals the number of cases from each circuit and the number affirmed or reversed (e.g. [October 2016 scorecard (PDF)](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SB_scorecard_20170628.pdf)). Their 2006 summary includes this also but not in a neat little table.

&gt; Most often the claim you'll see thrown around is that the Ninth Circuit has a far higher reversal rate than the other circuits, which simply isn't true. Several of the other circuits also have reversal rates up in the 70-80% range, such as the Sixth Circuit which had ~81% of its decisions reversed from 2007 through 2020.",comment,/r/progun/comments/wu9f19/ninth_circuit_sends_the_hawaii_concealed_carry/ila5tza/,progun

For example, a lot of capitalist arguments are ""well they tried that in Cuba and it didn't work"" or ""in china the state controlled businesses and it didn't work"" the problem with these arguments is that they encourage democratic socialism. Most of the people who are arguing for democratic socialism are saying ""well we won't do that, or we will be democratic"" and this results in a debate where no one can really prove their points. Another problem is these arguments leave a lot of room for people to use outside factors. One time I was arguing with a socialist who said that the economy in the USSR failed because the nation hadn't been industrialized. It was hard to argue his point. 

One solution to this problem is to argue against socialism differently. Mises did a good job of this with his arguments on the exploitation of surplus value and other issues.

Anyway.  Here it goes.  It's pretty simple.

Capitalism is based on competition and how to bring about the lowest prices in order to grow.  How do you get your prices the lowest?  Economy of scale.  Making more of each item reduces overall cost.  This is because each item has a lower share of fixed cost when they are produced in higher numbers.  That makes total sense.  But now we require more physical recourses as in natural resources taken from the earth or from population growth.  Those are finite or they may often cost more as it is harder or more expensive to extract more.

What if we made a system that gives everyone low cost to free healthcare but also pays pharma companies their current rates so they continue drug development. My idea would be this: The us government would allocate at least $10,000 per person to the healthcare system. this is what they already do. The first $2000 would go to subsidize medical products manufacturers and primarily drug and biotech companies. this would be an incredibly large assist to these companies as over $700 billion in assistance would be given to companies for them to collaborate with other companies, buy equipment and more. The next $8000 would go to the regular system. most health insurance companies charge around $4500-$5500 for a health insurance plan. $8000 per citizen would mean every citizen would get very good healthcare regardless of income. these insurance companies operate for profit, whereas the government does not need to operate for profit and can care for its citizens. 

Basically a summary of this plan is the government would give lots of money to companies to assist in drug research and development. Then the government would spend around $8000 per citizen to allow every citizen to get high quality of care. the higher spending allows for lower copays, and citizens with lower income would not have to pay a copay at all.

In a typical study setting, participants are asked a number of factual knowledge questions and their responses are compared to the correct answers. Then, the side whose partisans make the greatest errors is declared to be the most biased.

Unfortunately, this approach is extremely vulnerable to the biases of the researchers themselves. Consciously or subconsciously, the researchers are likely to select questions whose answers favor their own sides. For example, on the topic of Obamas economic policies, a left-leaning researcher might prefer questions such as:

*Did the unemployment rate decline under the Obama administration?* (Correct answer: *yes*).

In contrast, a right-leaning researcher working on the same topic, is more likely to ask

*Did the adult employment rate rise under the Obama administration?* (correct answer: *no*).

In both cases the study participants whose biases align with the biases of the researchers would be much more likely to answer the questions correctly.

To address this problem, we developed a machine-learning algorithm that should be able to correctly measure respondent bias even in cases where test questions were selected in a biased manner. The main idea behind the algorithm is to measure performance of participants along multiple axes. In addition to counting the total number of errors, we measure how much more likely a participant is to err in favor of a particular worldview (e.g., liberal, conservative, libertarian, etc.).

The algorithms accuracy improves as the amount of available data increases, so if you have a few minutes to spare, please help our research by taking any of these tests:

The capitalist is different from the feudal lord or the slaveowner because he or she (or more likely it, since the capitalist is likely to be a corporation) buys labor for a wage rather than exchanging it for the right to use land or compelling it by brute force. But why would anyone be willing to sell his or her labor to a capitalist? That may seem like a silly question today, when the need for jobs is a given. However, you only need a job because you cannot support yourself by your own independent efforts  and you probably cant, for the simple reason that you do not have access to the things you need: tools, materials, machines, a distribution network for the things you make  unless you become the employee of a capitalist. Capitalism was only able to get going because a lot of people who had lived on the land were driven off it by the enclosure movement. Once they had no other way to support themselves, they became available as full-time wage laborers. If you have no other way to live, you have to get a job, whether you think the wages are enough or not. Workers can try to force up the wage level through collective bargaining  but if they are in the job market as individuals, it is not a free exchange; one side, the employer, can dictate the terms.""

               companies use input quality to reward or punish them.

Poultry companies pay their contractors in a so-called tournament system in which they compete with nearby farms. Poultry farmers have said for years that they fear publicly airing grievances with the tournament system because of potential retaliation from companies in the form of lower pay or worse inputs, like sick chicks or low-quality feed.

I will try to give my overview on the matter.

1. **Many Layers Removed** \- central planners tend to be many layers removed from the people on the ground and do not have the visibility and information those people do. Often it is the case that they do not really ask them or allow them to make decisions. 
2. **ECP** \- the economic calculation problem is another way of looking at the issue of lack of knowledge or lack of information in dynamic systems for central planners. Central planners cannot know the price of a resource at any given point in time, so they cannot allocate that resource accurately. That lack of knowledge can lead to misallocation that can lead to shortages. That lack of knowledge can mean much slower reactions to resolve any bottlenecks in the economy. The most famous types of shortages is typically related to shortages of food on a mass scale.
3. **Decision Bottleneck** \- If all big decisions have to happen in one centralised place then the different parts of the economy will be on hold waiting for those decisions to be made. In addition, if that central source is heavily bureaucratic then those decisions may happen even slower. Hopefully, no decision maker is on vacation when you need one. 
4. **No Skin in the Game** \- central planners are not directly involved or affected by the decisions that they make for other people. They do not incur any risk, so they have no issue taking risks on other peoples behalf. 
5. **Corruption** \- as central planners have a lot of power to effect people, it incentivises corrupt actors to approach those planners and persuade them to make decisions that will benefit those actors. This causes misallocation and negatively effects parts of the system the central planners are meant to plan for.
6. **Stopping Thought** \- the core idea of central planning is that the people who do the actions do not need to plan and do not need to think. They are just supposed to do what they are told, typically at the threat of force. Taking into consideration that the people closer to the ground have better information than central planners, they can therefore make better local decisions in some or most occasions. However, this process of thinking for themselves to solve problems is discouraged.
7. **Disincentives Against Innovation** \- Typically, technological progress happens incrementally from trial-and-error and that sort of investigative process does not lend well to a country that has a 5 year plan. Technological innovation is an evolutionary process in which progress comes in spurts that generate accelerating returns. Under the logic of accelerating returns, positive feedback loops make each iterative process more effective, creating the potential for exponential growth. That sort of evolutionary system is very difficult to centrally plan for.",selftext,/r/Capitalism/comments/wgdmrf/why_centrally_planned_economies_dont_scale_and/,Capitalism

What is a good name for governments for, from, and by shareholders?

The greek for Shareholders are Meitokos. So Meithochoracy.

If you have better name, you can discuss it here

This is a good bridge between pure libertarian capitalism and practical reality in the world.

All governments and all countries have rulers. Those rulers are pretty much like owners. Weshpalian treaty means that rulers are effectively owners.

Basically rulers in a country can do whatever they want in their country and the other countries are supposedly doing nothing about it. Just like how ownership works.

Sure one country can ""invade"" another country. But that's usually wrong, very politically incorrect, and lead to war.

However, those rulership/citizenship are often obtained in a very non capitalistic way.

For example, some tyrants can seize power like Burma military junta.

Citizenships are given to American citizens based on place of birth. 

What about if power over a country, like normal ownership, is granted through capitalistic process. Earned by work like employee rewarded stock options. Inherited like estates. Or simply bought and sold.

Libertarians or anarchist dreams of having no rulers fail to see the practical reality that someone will always rule and whoever rule will always rule for their own interests.

So how do we balance that practical reality with economic efficiency?

We rearrange countries to be more like companies.

If you have any thoughts or other examples please let me know - thank you.

What I mean  is things like:

* In order to get tax breaks, banks have to invest a % of their profits into culture, but because it's purely a mechanism to reduce tax they don't really care how that money is spent, the only important thing is that it gets put towards cultural projects. I had a friend who worked at Deutsche Bank in a dept responsible for this and said it was surreal chaos, with huge amounts of money getting put towards absurd things.
* Last week at my work we had to do 1hr+ of fire emergency training, learning about chemical fires, gas fires etc. - all so that if we die from the building on fire our employers will be able to say to the insurers or whoever that we were trained in fire safety. Two days later the fire alarm went off in the office and we had no idea what to do, they hadn't prepped us for that! Corporate ass-covering results in some bizarre situations.

Can you think of any other examples or a formal way of describing this sort of process or result?

            U.S. multinationals shift twice as much profit as other multinationals relative to the size of their foreign earnings. 

We analyze how the location of corporate profits would change if shifted profits were reallocated to their source countries.

           Domestic profits would increase by about 20% in high-tax European Union countries, 10% in the United States, 
            and 5% in developing countries, while they would fall by 55% in tax havens.

Whenever I point out how major corporations have used wealth to hijack our democratic institutions via corporate lobbying I always get the same lazy answer. Downsize the government so that they have no one to bribe. Its like you believe deregulating the market will somehow create a slew of locally owned mom and pop shops all across America overnight. Thats not what will happen. What will happen is that big companies will exploit the gaps in regulation to become even more corrupt and powerful. We know this for a fact because its already happened once before. We used to have issues with companies creating their own towns so that they could better control the daily lives of their workforce. They even used to pay their workers in their own company scrip which could only be exchanged at company stores in their company towns. Monsanto is a particularly famous example of this. Under this system, workers did not have any chance of social mobility. Because they werent being paid in legal tender there was no possibility of being able to save up enough to move somewhere else. And this practice didnt stop until government regulation stepped in and made it illegal. 

You all act like in a free and unregulated market, that all problems of greed and corruption will simply fix themselves via market forces but thats not how it actually works. History has shown us that this is not how it works. History has shown us that in an unregulated market, power and wealth simply concentrates at the top and is then used to suppress and control people on the bottom.

Supporters of the capitalist economy believe that capitalism is the most efficient economic system that enables the improvement of living standards. However, many economists criticize the capitalist economy and list many problems for it. In short, capitalism can cause inequality, market failure , and economic cycles of boom and bust.
Ther is several logical reasons for saying that the capitalist system is not good!
Inequality:- Benefits in a capitalist system are rarely distributed equally, and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the population. This means that the demand for luxury goods is often limited to a small percentage of the workforce. The nature of capitalism causes the created inequality to increase for 2 reasons; These 2 reasons are: inherited wealth and profit from assets.
Instability:- The capitalist system relies on financial markets, including stocks, bonds, and money markets; But these markets cause periods of prosperity and bankruptcy. During the boom period, lending increases and creates irrational excitement in the markets, which is accompanied by an increase in asset prices. But when market conditions change, this boom can quickly turn into a bust. Falling markets cause recession, economic crisis and unemployment. The capitalist economy has suffered at various times from prolonged economic depressions (1930s), periods of widespread unemployment and declining living standards.
Exclusive power:- In a free market, successful firms can gain monopoly power and charge higher prices to consumers. Supporters of capitalism believe that only capitalism makes economic freedom possible. But the freedom of a monopoly can be abused and consumers have no other choice. In the 19th century, monopolies such as Standard Oil bought out competitors through often unfair competitive practices and then became very profitable.
Poor and rich interval:- Buyer's monopoly is market power in employing production factors. For example, companies can have monopoly power to hire workers and pay lower wages. This increases the profitability of companies; But it means that the workers do not have the same level of income as the capital owners. For this reason, despite the increase in the profitability of companies in the United Kingdom and the United States between 2007 and 2017, real wage growth has had a steady trend, that is not good.",selftext,/r/Capitalism/comments/w4h1dm/what_do_you_thinkpad_whay_people_hate_capitalism/,Capitalism

Reddit - I am not getting paid here, neither are most of you, yet this place is huge full of original content (the Internet's gravy) and making $$$. 

Youtube, Yelp, Amazon reviews, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc. etc. there are so many major (these are all tech) businesses that are basically user-driven and all rely on these ""free workers"" - users like you and me who think getting ""likes"" or getting into debates with anonymous online strangers is a great way to spend our lives... (except for businesses advertising or countries doing political things). 

The rise of ""gig"" businesses too - Uber, Airbnb, Amazon (&amp; plus) deliveries - these are all very low paying jobs that do not have to pay for benefits or give any kind of job security.

And in the business I am in - more than 50% (some people have said 70%) of universities and colleges are taught by part-time Professors. 

So like. To me it doesn't seem that capitalism is running on its old model really. 

I'm probably missing something so go easy - but what do you all think?

Is this the future of capitalism? It seems like it's moving away from capitalism and into a new space where so many things are available for free and worked for for free. But who knows...???

In theory says that the basic principles of socialism would work. What do we define as the basic principles of socialism, well I would say in simple 2 things:

1. The means of production (factories, companies, etc) are owned and controlled by the workers in the form of the state
2. The profits from these means of production are re invested towards the community and state. 

remember, this is an oversimplification of the idea, but those are two important aspects of the economic theory. 

for this idea to work 'in theory' we have to ignore all principles of capitalism in society. Lets take one example: the incentive to work is there when you can keep most of what you earn (most generally meaning in the average capitalist society there will be around 25-30% of your money taxed) with no ability to earn money, there will be little incentives to work, and the state will basically have to force everyone to work leading to a dictatorship. There are far more examples we could use, but the first reason in summary says that socialism cannot work in theory because it ignores basic economic reasons.

The second reason socialism cannot work in theory is because saying it works in theory allows other theories to also work. in theory, capitalism with no welfare or restrictions works as companies and workers will all find jobs and be happy. in reality? when a depression happens you have no welfare system, and your people are being denied basic human rights in the name of your anarchist economic theories. basically, ignoring basic market principles and ethics is required to say these ideas work in theory.

&amp;#x200B;

The third reason is that many of the beliefs of socialism were false. for example, one of Marx's basic theories was that the poor get poorer, yet salaries usually rise over time and people earn more as they get older, with a combination of the government setting minimum wages and workers acquiring education and skills getting them better jobs. With false basis for economic theories, your ideas cannot work in theory as they were flawed from the start.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps this is true but there are multiple ways to eliminate profits and giving that profit to the workers is only one and it is one that benefits the works above all else.

Given that profit could equally be considered as revenue stolen from the customer in the form of unnecessarily high prices or stolen from suppliers as unnecessarily haggled for low prices or it could be donated to charity, it seems at least somewhat selfish that the default assumption is that the profits necessarily belong to the workers.

In essence, a business owner could easily eliminate all profit which would leave workers no better paid but I dare say that most of the r/antiwork crew would not be particularly impressed with a solution that has this outcome.

All of that being said and accepting that it's at least somewhat antagonistic in its framing, how am I wrong?.",selftext,/r/Capitalism/comments/vvcbko/are_socialists_just_as_greedy_as_crony_capitalists/,Capitalism

Hope you are well!
Recently, all the media are talking about abortion, and governments say that abortion is illegal and no one should do such a thing, but some people and some big companies are against the prohibition of abortion and as much as possible for It helps women to leave the country and have an abortion.
In short, some people think abortion is a good and some people think is not good. I wrote this because my boss is a very curious and intelligent person and he has this idea about this:-
( 1: Can't afford them, don't breed them
2: How is that related to a libertarian tweeting to legalize child labour .
3: Nobody should be able to force others to support their children Child labors have poor parents that choose to breed So nobody should be forced to be responsible for their children. Also if the child want to be labor it is their right Especially if the child will starve otherwise. Then it's the only way Forcing financially responsible people to support someone else's children is slavery.)
I don't have a specific opinion and I don't know much about this, and I can't say whether this is good or bad. As far as I am concerned, I agree with my boss, but not completely, because my opinion is that:- If a woman is smart and thinks logically and loves herself, she should live and communicate with a man who loves himself and not her body. And have complete respect and trust in her and protect their child properly so that they are not forced to have an abortion.
To be honest, I think marriage is the best way because both parties can build a good life for themselfes and their children by agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We trade when we want to get what we want from others

2. We move to better competitors when terms are not reasonable or create competition. If we can't do neither, then perhaps the original terms are **reasonable**

3. We prevent others from doing bad things to us. That is, we ensure that people simply can't do evil to us.

4. We enforce our own contract and our right by automatic means counting on things that work naturally or automatically.

5. We are selfish and greedy and expect others to be selfish and greedy

6. We avoid situation where the last 5 solution is not appropriate

And I think those 6 principles should be the spirit of capitalism. It leads to most freedom and prosperity not only for us but for others.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want someone to do something for you and the person want you to do something for the person, you trade.

&amp;#x200B;

If both agree to trade but the terms are unreasonable, you introduce competition.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I want government to protect me and build roads. So we trade. I pay tax. I got to use roads and got protection from cops also I don't go to jail. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the terms are unreasonable. Why the fuck the tax is proportional to my income? Cops protection sucks. And so on and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution is we need more new states in the world to compete with old states. Other solution is to incorporate or move to lower tax states.

&amp;#x200B;

You can argue that you're right and they should agree with you. You can try to make the person like you.

&amp;#x200B;

Many white people insist this is the only way to get sex, for example. I think it violates 1 and 3 and 4. A husband can lost a lot of money by simply having his wife leaving him. Marriage is a very stupid non capitalistic solution. Not to mention marriage is a complex contract that requires governments to be involved. I thought most libertarians hate governments?

&amp;#x200B;

You can threaten. You can just literally force. Bound the person and drag him away. You can lock your doors so thieves don't come in.

&amp;#x200B;

But the standard solution for a capitalist is usually to just trade.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are all solutions that may work or even be legitimate. For example, if people want to rob us, it's a bad idea to negotiate. Just shot him.

&amp;#x200B;

But the most standard solution is always trade.

&amp;#x200B;

Another standard solution to PREVENT people to do bad stuff to you is make sure they can't. Again, there are other solutions, like being vengeful, for example. But usually far less effective.

&amp;#x200B;

Calling the cops are great too but make things more complicated. 

&amp;#x200B;

What about if someone said that we send money to us so we should send the goods. How do we know he's not lying? Suing him if he lies? No. We check the blockchain and see if money comes in. When transaction is small, and we got burned, we got burned small. We verify that each side do their part and we say thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I think the whole spirit of capitalism can be summarized by how much we prefer these standard solutions for all of our problems.

&amp;#x200B;

And I think one of the reason why libertarians are not as successful as feminism, as a movement, is because many libertarians do not even use standard capitalistic solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, your government raise tax. What do most libertarians do? Vote? Okay. Effect is minimum. Say it's wrong. Again, that violates principle 5. While right and wrong exist, it's just not practical to count on it. Some libertarians even say we can't vote. Can you vote as shareholders in companies? Why shouldn't you vote as citizen in your country? If you don't like being taxed, either pay up, or have money in tax haven. See. Principle #3.

885,"['much right', 'socialism', 'opinion']","How Cancer Cells Will be Treated With Government Universal Healthcare

A government appointed doctor see me. Ah you got cancer cells.

Don't worry. The cancer cell will die by itself naturally. Everyone have some cancer cells.

However, each of those cancer cells have as much right to live and reproduce as your healthy cells as I am taught in mandatory classes in government regulated universities.

So here are 2 pills. The redwing pills will prevent the cancer cells from aborting themselves.

The leftwing pills will ensure your cancer cells are well fed and can reproduce uncontrollably and create real cancer phenomena.

I told the doctor that I wanna shop for another doctor. Nope. That's not how universal healthcare work.  


Update: From the comment, most people don't seem to get it. The cancer is an allegory. I am not talking about cancer but government in general. The idea is that parasites like welfare recipients and robbers, and burglars are like cancer cells, and the government either prevent them from reproducing (anti abortion) and/or subsidize their reproduction (public school, welfare). Hence, we have more and more parasitic people and more socialism.  


That being said, I bet real universal healthcare will eventually be like that if socialism keep getting more and more votes. That is, instead of making you healthy, doctors will make you pay to cut off your dick, making you even more sick, etc. After all, you can't shop around. Just now, healthcare is very expensive already due to socialism.

From there, the attackers can do things like control its microphone and camera, and steal the user's browsing and communications history.

Lockdown Mode is intended for the small number of people who think they may be targeted by a state-sponsored hacker and need an extreme level of security. Victims targeted by military-grade spyware include journalists, human rights activists and business executives, according to The Washington Post. Spyware also has allegedly been used to target public officials, including a French minister and Catalan separatist leaders in Spain.

There are several types of mercenary spyware, but the best-known version is Pegasus, which was developed by NSO Group in Israel. Recently, researchers at the University of Toronto and Amnesty International have discovered and documented versions of this kind of spyware targeting iPhones.

NSO Group has previously said that its technology is used lawfully by governments to fight pedophiles and terrorists.

NSO Group is disliked by big tech companies, especially Apple, which markets its devices as more secure than the competition. Apple sued NSO Group last year, saying that it is malicious and that it damaged Apple's business. Facebook parent Meta is also suing NSO Group over its alleged efforts to hack WhatsApp.

Last November, the U.S. Commerce Department blacklisted NSO Group, preventing U.S. companies from working with it, one of the strongest measures the U.S. government can take to strike at foreign companies.

Apple says the vast majority of the 1 billion iPhone users will never be targeted. Mercenary spyware like Pegasus can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Apple says, so the tools are valuable and are only used to target a small number of users. Once new versions of spyware are discovered, Apple patches the bugs that they use, making the original exploits ineffective and forcing vendors like NSO Group to reconfigure how their tools work.

many libertarians.  


Most basically want role of government to be replaced by private businesses. For example, governments used to regulate taxi. Now, we have uber. A win.

&amp;#x200B;

Other wants governments to be as small as possible, and the rest are replaced by private parties. That's almost synonym right?  


I am thinking instead of thinking of smaller and smaller government running into ridiculous problems like [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling)  


What about if the government itself is **like** a private business. Of course the differences between governments that are private businesses and the government that are private businesses are just semantic.  


So it has share holders and the shares can be bought and sold like any company shares. For those who are used to democracy, it can be arranged that the shareholders must be an adult that live there (or meet citizenship requirement like in normal democracy). Again, the shares can be shared if the adult leave permanently.  


And like normal private businesses it has territory (land it owns), it has armies (security guards), it can make the laws (bylaws), it has constitution (or agreements to select board of directors and CEOs). Basically it's a company that can self enforce it's contract without the need of help from outside governments too much.  


Think of reddit, ebay, and twitter, and facebook, but offline. Most of the time when we break facebook rules, facebook don't call cops right? Those companies just enforce their own rules.   


The governments do NOT have to be libertarian or even minarchist. It can be muslims only, woke only, conservatives, christians only, white only, black only and so on and so on. Just like shops don't have to be silk road. There are many shops.   


Basically it's like VOC and other corporations. It's government by, for, and from shareholders. That's the basic idea.

The freedom of the population is maintained mainly by competition with other nations. If one such nation legalize slavery, for example, then the ""slaves"" will just escape to another country. As usual, any country that's too unfair will face rebellions anyway, like any countries.  


The fairness of the government is maintained mainly by desire of shareholders to max out valuation of their shares. For example, if the nation have shitty roads, investors won't come and that means less tax/revenues. Too much tax and no one want to live there, and that means less tax/revenue. Etc.  


How do we ensure that the government will not be like Congo free state? Well, we don't. Nothing is 100% guaranteed in this world.  


Actually, any government can end up like Congo free state. But there will be obvious safeguards that's simply not available hundreds of years ago.  


For example, a government or a nation need acknowledgements by other governments. It's real politic. Otherwise such governments will wage war all the time. I do not think countries like NATO would want to be protectors of any governments that practice torture.

The governments can be democratic. Basically, the shareholders are the adult citizens. And those shareholders can vote like every citizens in normal democracy.

Also the best and brightest can always move to other nations if the state sucks.

Like shares, however, the citizenship can be bought and sold at market price. For example, if a citizen don't like living in the country, he can sell citizenship to other people wanting to get in. He can also rent his citizenship.   


So how will this make things more libertarians? It doesn't. However, one of many new states created will relatively be more libertarian than the others. We just move there.  


Now let's see how this solution can fix some problems over normal libertarianism.  


Imagine if you have a corporation where government is very lax. Think of US during BLM riots or corporations whose headquarters are in remote regions with cheap land. Say a bear come to the corporate headquarter. Calling cops are useless.  


Under democracy, each shareholder much vote whether they want to pay security services to remove the bears. Under ""libertarian democracy"" every single person must vote yes for the company to hire security services to move the bears. This is kind of absurd right?  


But that's of course not what we normally do. What happened is that the shareholders (citizens) have appointed a CEO (or presidents) to make decisions on what to do like this.  


In fact, for minor issues like this, the CEO (or presidents) must have let governors/majors (middle managers/managers) to simply tell their soldiers (security guards) to pepper spray the bear and kick the bear out. The whole process is pretty much uhuk uhuk uhuk centralized planning.  


But centralized planning isn't always bad. Almost every business is governed by centralized planning method. Yes, some businesses are decentralized like many exchanges. However, we don't expect, even in a libertarian regime, to have all crypto exchange to be a dex? Some cex are fine too. Some centralized planning are fine.

The problem with governments we now have is that there are too much centralized planning.  


For example, what happened if someone is a trans? One country can just say fuck, this is an abomination. Another libertarian one can say, we tolerate it. But then, that's it. We just tolerate. The trans will unlikely to get a date or a job. Few people want to be close to them.  A woke country can say not only we will tolerate trans, we will pay for their expensive operation, and we will force the whole country to call them with proper pronouns, like thee, thou, ye, hi, hello, or whatever. Modern english is not my main language.

To be honest, who knows which one is the best strategy. With countries like corporations, each can move to  country that match their ideologies.  


Now, obviously whatever the decision is, somebody will be happier and another will not. Say only adult population can be shareholders. Those who don't like it can sell their citizenship to those wanting to get in. If too many people are not happy, then the price of citizenship will drop. If a lot of people wanting to come in, then the price of citizenship will go up.  


Or population can be like customers like we are population of reddit. We can move to other places. It's up to reddit to decide their rules to maximize numbers of visitors/customers to it's site.  


So yea, the nation (or corporation) can make decisions like any normal nations (corporation). We have leaders. Those leaders will be called CEO, Kings, investors, investors of investors, kings of kings, venture capitalists of venture capitalists, your highness, president or whatever, that reports to board of directors, senates, or whatever that report to shareholders. Roads can either be built by government or by private parties, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, most libertarians, minarchists, and anarchists, concern itself with freedom from others' rules.  


However, there are other values most libertarians like despite consent. What about fairness? What about if power and wealth is distributed to those who contribute to the society or economy? What about positive choices? Choices where each individuals can go to places they think is right more?

Normally the more localized a choice, the better. The more fair the outcome the better.   


Is it fair that twitter can set twitter rules. Sure. Why? Because whoever own twitter is either the founder or buy shares from the founder. Twitter is not governed by idiot. If you want to change twitter, you either buy it, like Elon Musk buy it or you contribute to it. Either you found it or you work at it as CEOs or employees and got lots of stock options.   


In normal government cradle to grave welfare recipients and refugees can keep breeding and coming and after that, due to democracy, they will eventually have power to rule others' citizens. That is ruling without contributing.

Here, by making the nation more like company, every shareholders must contribute something to the nation/company/other shareholders, before they have their own share. Otherwise it'll hurt interests of other shareholders.

So instead of minimizing ""ruling"" we balance ruling and contributing.

Instead of insisting that government is minimal, we make sure that power, like money, or shareholders are earned productively. Not by just having more children or being born in the right location. But by actually contributing positively to either the economy or the society.  


Elon Musk can buy twitter, and after that he can pretty much do whatever he wants. The same way, people that can vote and rule the population need to either buy shares, or serve in the army, or contribute something to the nation.  


It's kind of hard to live without rules. If you go to eBay, Amazon, reddit, or twitter or any shops, you got to obey the rules of those shops. Well, you can break it like criminals break the law, but most of the time, those private entities will enforce their own rules instead of calling the cops right? So they're like governments.  


However, most libertarians will agree that eBay, Amazon, reddit, and Twitter doesn't violate NAP. If you don't like their rules you can simply not use their service (or try not to get caught). Basically, what's important is not small governments. What's important is each individuals, like customers, can individualized the governments they want by simply moving.

As more and more countries are build like this, we will all have choices. Those who are not libertarians can build and go to their own muslim, christian, blm, woke, countries. Those who like it can go to it's libertarians countries.  


Can we start now? Sure. Just create DAO in some blockchain for shares. Proposes constitutions, etc. Then start making deals to buy some cheap land in some failing state. Turn existing population into shareholders. Basically, some investors will need workers and the existing population can earn their citizenship by working. Some refugees can be placed there. Then, let the market decide.  


There are plenty of cheap land in Afghanistan, Russia, middle east, Venezuela. Their government need money. They can't even feed their population. Remember, it's the sick that needs doctors, not the healthy. Also it's the sickest poorest state that need capitalism. The original citizen can agree to investor offers the normal way. Referendum in democracy, or concessions by kings/tyrants/etc.  


Some questions 

1. Is this practical. With the exception that citizens can sell their shares, this is pretty much the way our whole planet is governed. Every nations are like their own corporation. World ""government"" if any, is very little. Short of WTO and defense pact, we don't have world government. Our planet political structure is effectively an anarchy.
2. In fact, inspiration of this idea is from Wesphalian treaty. Our world is already almost like this. Nations compete with one another instead of waging war against one another.
3. The US is a relatively free country in the world. It happens because it is a federation. People that don't like living in one state can move to another state. Most problem in US happened due to federal government. Most freedom violation, like war on drugs happened due to federal government. Most state rules are reasonable because states with unreasonable rules will be left by people.
4. Will this be beneficial for the shareholders? Yes. VOC is very successful. It starts of as one of tiny player in Indonesian archipelago it conquer the whole Indonesia. Indonesians got to unite to finally be able to kick the dutch out. We are talking about a small number of dutch overpowering indonesians with many more people. EIC in India is too.
5. Will this be beneficial for the people? In the past no. But not as bad as you think. VOC, for example, is not MUCH worse than the kingdoms at his time. For example, VOC did some genocide on Banda island. However, the Bandanese, before that, massacred VOC's ambassador and the governor general of VOC in Batavia was the only surviving member of the massacre. Also the VOC captured Sumatra because the muslims in Sumatra are committing genocide against their fellow muslims. So while EIC and VOC did some atrocities, it is not more insane than standard at that time. Before VOC comes, kingdoms in Indonesia wage war against each other too.
6. Will this be democracy? Well, we can arrange that shareholders must stay in the region for at least a few years or something. We can arrange that only those who live there can be citizens. This is optional.
7. Will this be libertarian? Well. The whole globe is actually very libertarian already. If each nation is a person, then the whole world is libertarian. This doesn't have to be a libertarian. I would be surprised if no libertarian countries or close to libertarian countries don't show up. The point is, each people can move to the country they like. Not everyone is going to like libertarianism. Hence insisting that a region is libertarian is hardly necessary.
8. Can it attack or be attacked by other states like VOC. Who knows? Again, let international laws handle that. Again, in ancient time, voting power come in exchange of conscription. We can arrange that those defending the nation can get citizenship, or extra citizenship it can sell at market price.
9. Every nation in the world is already qualified. Again, being able to buy and share citizenship or anything is pretty much optional. A nation must reasonably be fair, or otherwise face rebellions. A nation must be strong enough to defend itself, at least till allied friends arrive, like Ukraine. You know. Basic deals. We just need more choices and more players in the market of nation states industries.

They would first have to reestablish connections with Chinese buyers to climb out of the 2019 trough$13.6 billion lower than the agreement's 2017 baseline levelbefore chipping away at the additional $200 billion.

China ended up buying none of that extra $200 billion of US exports it had promised to purchase. (In Davos, only a week after it was signed, Trump boasted that the deal ""could be closer to $300 billion when it finishes."") In 202021, China fell $15.8 billion short of reaching even the baseline level of purchases.

The global economy recovered in 2021, with China's economic growth rebounding to 8.1 percent and the United States growing 5.7 percent. Chinese goods imports from the world were 31 percent higher in 2021, and US goods and services exports to the world finished up 19 percent.

The trade war was also costly to the US economy through the impact of the US tariffs. Numerous economic studies have documented that the effect of the tariffs was to raise prices and hurt American consumers and companies buying imported inputs, harming American competitiveness by reducing employment and sales.     Some sectors and workers may have benefited from the US tariffs, but those gains were more than offset by losses by others, resulting in overall damage to the US economy.

second criticism was im not having patience for vague term like 'marxism' and 'socialism' because by some definition ellerman is being BITTER and VENEMOUS anti marxist and BITTER and VENEMOUS anti socialist but by other definition of Beddingstonsquire some how (??) david ellerman is being included in 'marxism' and 'socialism'..my thought is being 'a person must be consciously dishonest to be consiously using words that they are consciously knowing is being gobbleygook and contradictory and confusing to every one..stop using these words bc you are consciously knowing it is meaningles and contradictory and confusing scare words..some people think socialism means tyranny of the government and some people think it means some thing else and WHO CARES..honest people try to be clear and not trying to purposely use words they are KNOWING is being very vague and confuse and scary..you cannot be claiming 'o i didnt know this was being very vague and confuse and scary word for the population..you know VERY well that these words are useless and scary and confuse so its being a dishonest choice to be delibertarately using this teriminlogy when you areknowingt hat very, very well.'

apart from these frustration i am having i am thinking Beddingtonsquire is super smart and is raising excellent points

here is being their points

first: 

&gt;the abolition of the employment contract, an effective communal ownership and control over the workplace and production - this is just socialism.

&gt;The idea that labour hires capital and some reversal justifies getting rid of the employment contract doesnt make any sense to me. In fact, as an individual people are free to hire capital and do keep the fruits of their labour. 

&gt;This twist where someone comes along and hires my office to work on my product and they keep the fruits of that, its just not going to fly because it ignores all of the risks and investment that it took to get there for an established business. Is this worker hiring capital really going to cover the returns process? Or a customer inquiry? Will they have the resources to deliver on anything made in a group setting.

&gt;This notion of the worker owning their output is incoherent for anything that isnt as basic as making a wooden chair. It simply has no standing in the complex goods and services of our economy where a very clear line of ownership from the capitalist addresses all of these issues.

&gt;The edge case is the idea that because someone is not allowed to sell themselves into lifelong servitude, the entire notion of the employment contract is suspect. I just dont buy it.

second (this point here is sounding interesting but the truth is i have no idea what is being meant by the 'socialism' and im really not caring but i guess i need to be finding out to be knowing what this point is intended to be meaning): 

&gt;What Ellerman is arguing for is effectively the same as socialism because the owner dynamic wouldnt exist. Its just as bad an idea as socialism.

third: 

&gt;It seems like question 3 relates to the argument I previously made against Ellermans work on this subreddit. This is the edge case example that Im referring to. That we have restricted some contracts does not give sufficient ground or argument in of itself to restrict more. Its like saying that because restrictions are arbitrary, its okay to set that arbitrary line anywhere, that is nonsense.

&gt;The arguments he makes are not difficult for a libertarian to counter so Ill take them one at a time.

&gt;1 - Life servitude does not allow for leaving a deal, alternatives cannot be considered and this it goes against free trade to never allow someone to back out. This is similar to how a life sentence doesnt actually mean life - it falls into cruel and inhumane.

&gt;2 Coverture is similarly anti-individualist and thus anti-libertarian. Something that is self-contradictory to the system cannot be allowed if the system is to stand.

&gt;Subjection is similar to covet JRE, it contradicts the very nature that allows people to make free decisions under liberty.

&gt;The employment contract has none of these issues; unlike the others it can be both freely entered into and freely exited.

&gt;My remaining points stand, the notion that owning the means of production can go both ways is unworkable, they can go one way or the other, though capital owner is the most efficient. Complex systems simply cannot tolerate the ownership of the fruits of your labour to be split among many on an ad-hoc basis as suggested.

However, if you want to be considered rich by residents of large metropolitan areas, it will require even more wealth. 

In San Francisco, the threshold for what's considered wealthy is a net worth of $5.1 million. That's the highest total in the survey, which examined 12 of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country. 

To be considered ""financially comfortable,"" a San Francisco resident would need a net worth of at least $1.7 million, the survey finds.

Here's a look at what it takes to be considered wealthy by city in 2022, as ranked by net worth thresholds:

San Francisco: $5.1 million
Southern California (includes Los Angeles and San Diego): $3.9 million
New York City: $3.4 million
Washington, D.C.: $3.3 million
Seattle: $3.2 million
Phoenix: $2.7 million
Boston: $2.7 million
Dallas: $2.6 million
Houston: $2.6 million
Atlanta: $2.5 million
Chicago: $2.5 million
Denver: $2.3 million
The online survey was conducted in early February, with a sample of 500 to 750 local residents for each metropolitan area, between the ages of 21 and 75.

This might be an extremist view and a strawman, but bear with me. 

My reasoning is that if a government has a high tax rate for the 'rich', a large amount of its income ( say 75% ) comes from this class, the government is de facto depends on this class for its survival and proper functioning . Whose well being and interests ( legitimate or otherwise ) it is going to protect ?.

So a small, say 10% of people/corporations paying taxes is what keeps government running ?. Does this not incentivize the government to protect the interests of this class. Sure paying taxes ( their fair due as it is said ) does not entitle them to any special treatment as they say, but if their bankruptcy puts a hole in your pocket and is going to cause to run out of money or loose elections they guarantee their survival.

The 'rich' ( corporations/people ) as a minority already have a disproportionate influence in society due to their wealth, do not legitimize their influence in government by taxing them more !.

This is going to be exasperated when the government is going to use this money as a welfare state. Where (in this scenario) the government is literally taking money from the rich and giving them to the poor hoping that they will not be poor while making sure that the interests of rich are also entrenched !.

People advocating for high taxes for the rich think it is free money, 'a free lunch'. But in my limited experience I would say that is true in only very rare situations. Money comes with open ( as in a bribe ) or hidden ( as in obligations ) motives whether the givers and takers acknowledge it. As is usual in democratic societies.

All these mess start due to protectionist and centralized planning.

In Ukraine, for example, the issue was simple. Both Russia and Europe offer Ukraine a trade deal. The catch? Russia don't want open trade with Europe. Why? I don't know.  They want to protect their industries from Europeans competition.

A very evil yet common reason why countries don't support free market.  So Ukraine president got to choose one or the other. He chose to deal with Russia first.  Then? We got a coup. So basically the parliament broke Ukraine constitution and install a pro Europe government. The violation of Ukraine own constitution can be a minor issue or a big deal depending on whether you're on Russian side, or Ukraine side.

Two regions in Ukraine then split up. However, those two are willing to rejoin if Ukraine became a Federation.  Federation means each regions can make their own rules and people can move to states with rules they want. For example, Russian speaking population prefer to speak Russia in their public school.

The US, for example, is the most advance country in the world because it is a federation.  For some reasons deals don't work. I have no idea what went wrong. Either Ukraine governments want a unified country where all regions will have to speak Ukrainian.

Or perhaps they agree on federation but the other side are stubborn. There are reports that pro Russian or pro Europe population in those 2 regions got killed. Instead of asking what they want, people just kill those they don't like.  We have 14 years war. 

From Russia points of view, (again, could be lying, or opportunistic). the attack on Ukraine is a way to prevent mass killings of people in donbaas luhanks, or at least it can reasonably be portrayed that way. As most government act, it fails horribly of course, because governments official have no incentive to do anything right.

Now, if only US, Russia, Europe, Ukraine, and the whole world want open trade with everyone, then who the hell care which region belongs to which countries? We all just move to where we like.",selftext,/r/Capitalism/comments/vpjjc0/war_in_ukraine_is_caused_by_centralized_planning/,Capitalism

Once completed, the Arizona factory and a surrounding cluster of suppliers, including a Taiwanese chemical company that has also started investing in the site, will create several thousand jobs, Kung said.

TUNA BOND FRAUD

Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to defrauding investors over an $850 million loan to Mozambique meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet and is paying U.S. and British regulators $475 million to settle the case under a deal announced in October.

About $200 million of the loan went in kickbacks to Credit Suisse bankers and Mozambican government officials. The bank was aware of a huge shortfall between the funds raised and the value of boats bought but failed to disclose this to investors when the loan was restructured in 2016, the regulators said.

Credit Suisse also arranged a loan that was kept secret from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When Mozambique admitted to $1.4 billion in undisclosed loans the IMF pulled its support, sending the southern African country's economy into a tailspin.

ARCHEGOS DEFAULT

Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion when U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management defaulted in March 2021.

The hedge fund's highly leveraged bets on certain technology stocks backfired and the value of its portfolio with Credit Suisse plummeted.

An independent report into the incident criticised the bank's conduct, saying its losses were the result of a fundamental failure of management and control at its investment bank, and its prime brokerage division in particular. read more

The report said the bank was focused on maximising short-term profits and failed to rein in voracious risk-taking by Archegos, despite numerous warning signals, calling into question the competence of its risk personnel.

GREENSILL FUNDS COLLAPSE

Credit Suisse was forced to freeze $10 billion of supply chain finance funds in March 2021 when British financier Greensill Capital collapsed after losing insurance cover for debt issued against its loans to companies.

The Swiss bank had sold billions of dollars of Greensill's debt to investors, assuring them in marketing material that the high-yield notes were low risk because the underlying credit exposure was fully insured. read more

A number of investors have sued the Swiss bank over the Greensill-linked funds. The bank has returned about $6.8 billion to investors so far.

SHAREHOLDER ANGER

Credit Suisse shareholders rejected a proposal from the bank's board to discharge management from other liabilities for 2020, highlighting shareholder anger of the bank's costly missteps. read more

The vote garnered only 35.88% approval at the bank's AGM in April, as proxy advisers pointed to risk and control deficiences leading up to the Greensill and Archegos meltdowns.

That leaves room for shareholders to hold directors responsible for wilful or grossly negligent violations of their duties under Swiss rules.

SPYING SCANDAL

Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam was forced to quit in March 2020 after an investigation found the bank hired private detectives to spy on its former head of wealth management Iqbal Kahn after he left for arch rival UBS (UBSG.S).

Credit Suisse repeatedly played down the episode as an isolated incident.

However, Switzerland's financial regulator said Credit Suisse had misled it about the scale of the spying. The regulator said the bank planned seven different spying operations between 2016 and 2019 and carried out most of them.

In a rare rebuke, the regulator said there were serious organisational shortcomings at Credit Suisse and that the bank had even tried to cover its tracks by doctoring an invoice for surveillance.

In response, Credit Suisse said that it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance. 

But...but...its Chinas fault...or N Korea..it Russias...or....who are the baddies again?

How Cancer Cells Will be Treated With Government Universal Healthcare

A government appointed doctor see me. Ah you got cancer cells.

Don't worry. The cancer cell will die by itself naturally. Everyone have some cancer cells.

However, each of those cancer cells have as much right to live and reproduce as your healthy cells as I am taught in mandatory classes in government regulated universities.

So here are 2 pills. The redwing pills will prevent the cancer cells from aborting themselves.

The leftwing pills will ensure your cancer cells are well fed and can reproduce uncontrollably and create real cancer phenomena.

I told the doctor that I wanna shop for another doctor. Nope. That's not how universal healthcare work.  


Update: From the comment, most people don't seem to get it. The cancer is an allegory. I am not talking about cancer but government in general. The idea is that parasites like welfare recipients and robbers, and burglars are like cancer cells, and the government either prevent them from reproducing (anti abortion) and/or subsidize their reproduction (public school, welfare). Hence, we have more and more parasitic people and more socialism.  


That being said, I bet real universal healthcare will eventually be like that if socialism keep getting more and more votes. That is, instead of making you healthy, doctors will make you pay to cut off your dick, making you even more sick, etc. After all, you can't shop around.

Among those denied an abortion, there was an increase in household poverty for at least four years relative to those who had an abortion. Years later, the women denied an abortion were more likely to lack the money to cover basic living expenses such as food, housing and transportation.

What's more, being denied an abortion lowered these women's credit scores, boosted their debt and increased negative financial records, such as bankruptcies and evictions, the study found.

While the right to abortion may remain legal in more than half the states, ""the impact would be absolutely enormous"" if it's banned nationwide, Myers said.

""This is a big setback for women's rights, both from a health and an economic standpoint,"" McClanahan added.

               And thats the real reason for denying abortion rights :  its the factory of poor people.....radicalized right will have a huge amount of

Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales, said on Thursday it would recall 2,700 bZ4X SUVs globally. Subaru Corp (7270.T), in which Toyota has a nearly 20% stake, also said it was recalling about 2,600 units of the Solterra, a related model.

                      who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Toyota had reported that one car, in particular, had been roughly handled. ""We don't know who the driver was, but the driver drove the car very hard,"" the official said, adding that Toyota had found the problem, which affected only a few cars.

In other words, the legislations intent is to make US spending priorities more favorable to the needs of the working class by using excess Pentagon capital to buttress social programs. As Lee and Pocan argued in the press release announcing the bill, showering the military with more and more money, year after year, not only fails to improve security  it actually produces insecurity by crowding out funding for addressing crises like climate change and pandemics.

Here is the [Study](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/06/21/study-shows-excess-corporate-profits-us-have-become-widespread), well it's an article about the study. You can access the study through the article. 

I want a healthy discussion on the basis and findings of this study. This is important, as I think people too often out-source their critical thinking to ""experts"", who's reasoning could be as flawed. 

The study claims that companies with ""high profit margins"" are to blame for inflation. It does this by referencing the law of supply and demand, and what happens when supply is low and demand is high. Naturally prices rise in this scenario. The claim is that since profit margins are ""high"", value is ""being stolen"" from workers and consumers, and going to shareholders. Their solution is to consider policies to suppress ""high profit margins"" and ultimately tax these companies, so that they don't have ""high profit margins"" anymore. 

I want to first tackle their reasoning for inflation. They claim it can come from three different scenarios, each one a claim of supply/demand situations. They then go on and say that it doesn't matter where it comes from, their ""solution"" should work anyways. It does matter where inflation comes from. There is empirical evidence that concludes that inflation can be explained by monetary policy. Milton Friedman's lectures and studies support this conclusion. An increase in the money supply outpacing production causes and increases inflation, not the profits of companies. 

Second, out of the gate they reference terribly faulty studies to support their claims, weakening their argument. This [Study](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/regulating-stock-buybacks-the-6-3-trillion-question/) is referenced and concludes that companies use their earnings to manipulate stock prices, and its conclusions are to force companies to reinvest. This study has no basis in reality, and only hooks onto the premise that ""stock buybacks are stock price manipulation"" without evidence. It also advocates a position of a command economy, where the government decides how companies are allowed to use their earnings.

Lastly, their conclusion to tax ""high profits"" seems to be missing any evidence or reasoning as to how this supports their claim. They state that it is necessary because there NEEDS to be a ""redistribution of wealth"". They make no claims and provide no evidence for why this needs to be the case. 

I want to make sure that people who are interested in economics and capitalism to be prepared to face and dispute these faulty studies, and maybe we can help stop policy makers from making decisions that don't support reality.",selftext,/r/Capitalism/comments/vi9368/studies_to_be_aware_of/,Capitalism

Most children will have richer parents. Only parents that can fully afford their children and pay those extra tax can have children. No more poverty and socialist voters

Removing government? You fucking kidding me? Instead, make government behaves like corporation. Each citizen has a share. Not much change, citizens can still vote. One man is still one vote (though some guys can buy more citizenships if the country is really fucked up)

With current voting system the bureaucrats decide where the money go. They just use the money to make problems worse. With UBI the market decide where money go. If poor people use it for drugs, LET THEM. Just make sure they don't breed.

Allow people to sell citizenship. Don't like it here? Well, someone else want to get in. Okay you can rent or sell your citizenship. Perhaps people should rent first and then if they are sure they can sell.

Open border? Seriously. If you have open border, there are 1 billion chinese that will happily move. Now I know chinese are diligent and smart and stuff. But they have their own interests that don't necessarily match yours.  


What about if communist party told them to vote communism? Voting right and open border don't mix and if I can choose among 2, democracy is still more practical. There are plenty of muslims that want to turn your country into shariah.  


Instead of open border, make immigration simpler like buying and selling shares. Sell visa. If you can pay certain amount per  year, you can stay. After that you leave. A mexican want to work in US? He can just compute amount of money he will make, pay visa fee, move back out.  


It's already happening. US and many other countries ""give"" citizenship in exchange of investments. Many countries give citizenship for surrendering soldiers. It can be cheaper than killing enemies soldiers.

Tax children. Do NOT subsidize children. Can't afford them don't breed them. Every children deserve good genes, be wanted, and rich parents. If parents are poor there is NO libertarian solution to fix children with poor parents. The most libertarian solution is let the children starve. That's not purely libertarian because it's not the children's fault. It's also cruel and won't win vote.   


Subsidize abortion and contraception. Again, if poor guy don't really want to have children, HELP THE FUCK OUT OF THEM. You want another socialist voters voting for more communism? What the fuck. Most poor kids are simply not genetically suited to contribute to economy.  


Tax land. Not income. It's much easier to compute. It doesn't even have to be precise. Government can say for these zones the tax is this much per square meter. For that zone the cost is that much. If government tax too much the price will drop and people move out. So as long as tax rate doesn't change too rapidly people that don't like it can just move.

Those analyses based on retirees with pensions found that they often didn't spend their savings at all. In fact, many saw their nest eggs continue to grow after they stopped working.

""This sanguine idea from the past might give a false sense of security though,"" Wettstein said.

Retirees with 401(k)s often spend savings quickly

Access to traditional pensions has been rare for decades now. Workers have increasingly been tasked with saving for their later years on their own in investment accounts, the poster child for which has been the 401(k) plan offered through employers.

But many retirees without a pension are reliant on their own nest egg to cover much of their monthly expenses.  Without a pension, people are also responsible for making sure they've saved enough to get them through their post-working years, a task that requires decades of adequate earnings and discipline.

In addition, a challenge with 401(k) savings plans is that they charge retirees with figuring out how much to withdraw each month. This calculation can be hard to hit right, and although those with sizeable savings aim to live off their money's earnings, the market is unpredictable and has periods- such as right now- where it takes more than it gives.

Property valuations in Bexar County, home to San Antonio, have increased by an average of 73 percent over the last 10 years, raising the tax bill of the average homeowner between $2,300 and $3,000, according to the county appraisal district. The number of homeowners protesting their valuations has jumped 50 percent in the past five years. Neighbors are helping each other apply for tax exemptions, and some residents are exploring housing trusts and historic preservation to protect their land. These things combined, residents say, leave them with few options to save their neighborhoods from the kinds of destabilizing changes that Austin has experienced.

San Antonio looks like what Texas will look like in 20 years and Texas looks like what the United States will look like in 20-25 years, said Roger Enriquez, a University of Texas San Antonio criminal justice professor who directs the schools engagement with the citys west side. The rest of the country needs to pay attention to whats happening here because its almost a crystal ball into the future and what will happen if solutions arent found.

There seems to be no way to stop it, said the retired teacher, whose property taxes increased to nearly $5,000 this year from $1,200 in 2010. She has tried to rally her longtime neighbors, but they seem resigned to the changes, she said. The city is just going to do what they want.

For if the buyer is always the one who decides whether to buy or not, it is certain that he will select among all the sellers the man who will give him at the best price the merchandise that suits him best. It is no less certain that every seller, it being his chief interest to gain preference over his competitors, will sell in general the best merchandise at the lowest possible price, in order to attract customers. It is not true therefore that a merchant may be interested in deceptionunless he has some exclusive privilege.

But if the government limits the number of sellers by exclusive privileges or otherwise, it is certain that the consumer will be wronged and that the seller, certain of selling, will compel him to buy bad articles at a high price.

If, on the contrary, it is the number of buyers which is diminished, by the exclusion of foreigners or of certain other persons, then the seller is wronged, and, if the injury is carried to the point where the price does not compensate him, with profit, for the costs and risk, he will cease to produce the commodity in such abundance, and scarcity will result.

The general freedom of buying and selling is therefore the only means of assuring, on the one hand, the seller of a price sufficient to encourage production, and on the other hand, the consumer, of the best merchandise at the lowest price. This is not to say that in particular instances we may not find a cheating merchant and a duped consumer; but the cheated consumer will learn by experience and will cease to frequent the cheating merchant, who will fall into discredit and thus will be punished for his fraudulence; and this will never happen very often, because generally men will be enlightened upon their evident self-interest.

To expect the government to prevent such fraud from ever occurring would be like wanting it to provide cushions for all the children who might fall. To assume it to be possible to prevent successfully, by regulation, all possible malpractices of this kind, is to sacrifice to a chimerical perfection the whole progress of industry; it is to restrict the imagination of artificers to the narrow limits of the familiar; it is to forbid them all new experiments; to renounce even the hope of competing with the foreigners in the making of the new products which they invent daily, since, as they do not conform to our regulations, our workmen cannot imitate these articles without first having obtained permission from the government, that is to say, often after the foreign factories, having profited by the first eagerness of the consumer for this novelty, have already replaced it with something else. It means forgetting that the execution of these regulations is always entrusted to men who may have all the more interest in fraud or in conniving at fraud since the fraud which they might commit would be covered in some way by the seal of public authority and by the confidence which this seal inspires, in the consumers. It is also to forget that these regulations, these inspectors, these offices for inspection and marking, always involve expenses, and that these expenses are always a tax on the merchandise, and as a result overcharge the domestic consumer and discourage the foreign buyer. Thus, with obvious injustice, commerce, and consequently the nation, are charged with a heavy burden to save a few idle people the trouble of instructing themselves or of making enquiries to avoid being cheated. To suppose all consumers to be dupes, and all merchants and manufacturers to be cheats, has the effect of authorizing them to be so, and of degrading all the working members of the community.""

Hoover also refused to help the workers, hence workers naming the place where they stayed hoovervilles. The government does have money, it's collected through taxes, debt and other small payments. During the great depression, the government spent a lot of money, sure, but FDR saw it as necessary. The great depression was so bad that ordinary market means wouldn't have lifted the people out of the depression alone, this also happened to be fair because banks had failed during the stock market crashes because they gave loans on the margin. (A long story but in short the banks failed) which means no business loans therefore even if there was purchasing power to create business incentives it would have been hard to start a business in the first place. One of the things FDR did was create the fdic which is what is the foundation for modern banks today to fall back on. It also gives people reassurance to put their money in the bank. FDRs work policies improved infrastructure in pretty much every regard in the us while also hiring a lot of workers to build these projects, while it did cost a lot of money it reduced employment and in this case reduced the money needed for government aid.

Getting more for the same price is also a price drop.  And many of the flagship model computers were more expensive even if you don't adjust for the massively increased capability.  The VIC-20 was not a high end system, you would more reasonably compare it to a chromebook today which could cost less in nominal dollars and would definitely cost a lot less in real dollars.

The first IBM PC to come out cost [up to $20k](https://history-computer.com/ibm-pc-5150-guide/) in 1975 dollars (and was itself cheaper than systems with similar capabilities from not too much before that, I didn't do the inflation calculation since its ""up to"" and not a precise figure, but even that nominal price is far above what people pay today)

In 1981 the IBM PC 5150 cost $1565.  About $5100 in today's dollars.  Now you would buy a typical business desktop PC for less than that in nominal dollars, and a very high end PC for less than that in real dollars.

And yes the software demands higher end hardware, but the requirements to run software have not gone up as fast as the power of PCs has gone up.  You can run the same workloads in emulation much faster than the old computers could, and you get more frames per second at 4K high color resolution with ray tracing on high end PCs now then you got at old CGA, EGA, or VGA computers in the past in games or in video rendering.  Even with the extra demands of today's software and the larger size of today's files you can recalculate a spreadsheet or query a database much faster then with the old computers.  As for communications I remember using modems that didn't transmit text as fast as I could type it, and downloads of files would take much longer back in the day even though the files are much larger now.",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wvh7jc/open_market_competition_drives_cost_down_so/ilj8nb8/,Capitalism

NYC is rent controlled, which has held back the supply of new housing, and created all kinds of distortions in the NYC market. In what fucking way is this an ""open market"" ?

The next laugh I had was the article's praise of the Inflation Reduction Act, which will not in fact reduce inflation. Even if it performs as its sponsors intend, it would reduce the deficit in 2031 by just 4%, and increase it in the near term (it proponents claim inflation reduction through reduced deficits). The reality it, given all the pork potential in it, not to mention pointless GND subsidies and regulation, it is far more likely to cost more and increase deficits. Based on almost every government program ever launched in the US, thats they way to bet anyway.

In fact, if you look at things that have risen versus declined in price, government subsidies or interference is the main culprit for rising prices.

Third, if ""corporate greed"" were the issue,  why now ? Why weren't companies raising prices basically ALL THE TIME ? Were they just nicer when Trump was president ? Of course not. The ""corporate greed"" reasoning in the article is simply garbage.

Lastly, its quite hard to measure inflation. Many times, the price of something may go up, but you get much more value for your dollar. To take an example, a 1967 Ford Mustang cost around $2,500 new, or around $23k in today's dollars. However, that car did not have disc brakes, cruise control, airbags, and all kinds of other safety innovations we take for granted now. Even if you had infinity money in 1967, you couldn't get these things, because many didnt even exist. Meanwhile, today you can buy a brand new Kia Forte for $25k that is better in ever way than that shitty Mustang. Safer, more reliable, and on and on.

That contradiction is: If corporate ""greed"" is responsible for prices being high and staying high, why now? What events has made this phenomenon a one-of-a-kind situation? Why hasn't corporate ""greed"" been the argument before?

I will go into the harder part of the argument, which is convincing you of the alternative reason for higher prices.

Prices are set by markets. What this means is that people have their own preferences on prices, and that collectively creates a market for products and services. Anytime that product or service gets outside the individual's cost, they find alternatives.

Today's commodities are priced on a global level, meaning when you buy natural gas, you are competing for buyers across the globe. This makes demand greater than what your local area seems, and can often skew perception about prices.

A business simply does not make money when people don't buy or go to alternatives. If demand is so high, then high prices should incentivize more suppliers to start up. Supply accessibility larger depends on how regulated the market is in the jurisdiction.

Plenty of examples of commodities with prices that have come down substantially (or quality vs price is significantly more) for the past couple decades, excluding recent inflation:
TVs
Smartphones
Food
Furniture
Home electronics

The article even stated that wholesale market commodities will go down in price. Why? Because that's a very competitive market.

What's not competitive? New York rentals. Not only that, but the article does mention that renters largely accepted the new terms, so the market theory works. If it was too much for an individual, they would seek alternatives.

If the solution to this problem is to seize the assets of individuals (or do anything tanget, like price caps) for use to the government on the grounds of ""economic equality"", then both economic theory will be discarded, and the situation for many more people will get worse.

I would consider taking a look at other news sources as well for a more well-rounded opinion on the situation. This article itself is biased towards government intervention, misleading when it adds in the Inflation Reduction Act (which doesn't actually reduce inflation), misleading when it says that landlords lobbied for higher prices (they lobbied against price caps, not for price floors), and only grabs opinions and citations from economists that follow the narrative the author is trying to portray.

Before you buy something, ask yourself if it's really something you want to buy at that price. By accepting a higher price and purchasing that item, you are signaling to the market that you are willing to take a higher price.

EDIT: I will also mention that this also looks like the case of Vice twisting the findings of an economist. The economist points to areas where the market theory is working, but Vice sees it not as a market, but as ""corporate greed.""

Take rent for instance. During Covid the government forbade landlords from collecting rent. Why would a landlord build new properties to meet the rental demand if not allowed to collect rent? Also, why would a landlord NOT increase rent when rent controls are removed to recoup some of his losses.

Most of the reason that businesses don't drop their prices after inflation is lack of competition. When competition is strong the market will adjust to the most efficient producers and prices will come down. Look at what Natural gas did from 2010 to 2015 due to increased supply from the Marcellus shale from fracking. The price was $100/bbl and dropped to $40/bbl. No government intervention, just a supply glut.

If producers are allowed to produce without government intervention the supply and demand will eventually meet and prices will come down. However, it is nearly impossible to prevent government intervention. New minimum wage laws, the devaluation of the money, input costs for everything all contribute to increases in prices. Government regulations and monetary policy drive many of those price increases.",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wvh7jc/open_market_competition_drives_cost_down_so/ilfwwud/,Capitalism

I appreciate you're new to economics so I don't mean to be critical but suggest you adjust your thinking slightly. It starts with the premise that capitalism is somehow responsible for food waste or food not getting distributed equally. This is one of the biggest flaws in anti-capitalist arguments in my opinion. Thomas Sowell writes that capitalism isn't some concocted system that is designed to distribute goods in a way that has the optimal outcomes in every way such as preventing environmental problems or inequality. It is in fact the default system which is just an evolution of the early barter system but with modern tools such as fiat currency and debt, etc. 

The issues we often find are the result of bad government policy, human nature and the complexities that come with feeding people on a scale never before seen in all of history (the population of the planet was just 2 billion only 100 years ago). To try and look to capitalism as if it is some system designed to handle these problems is a bad premise. The real question is what system could be better? Also it's worth pointing out that we are nowhere close to a pure capitalist system in any country (including the US). Just read some government regulation for a few years and after you've gotten through maybe 1% of all regulation then you'll see why I say this.

Of course socialists or communists, for instance, would state that their proposed systems are superior to capitalism but looking at the evidence it's difficult to see why they say this. The biggest mass starvation events in history were under communist or socialist regimes. Now of course the retort is going to be ""but that wasn't true socialism / communism"" but these arguments ring hollow when we see the same things over and over again (soviet union, China under Mao, Venezuela).",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wuuaw4/capitalism_and_food_distribution/ilfoyx1/,Capitalism

IMO this is one of the greatest misconceptions and the reason for so many of the failings of modern capitalism, maybe second only to fiat central banking.

Governments should only protect citizens from violent crime, theft and property damage.

If you choose to lend a car to somebody, you take on the risk that they will total it or steal it. You have *given* them this car to use, and so it is their property until they *give* it back.

Insurance companies could easily quantify and ameliorate these risks, and protect the car owner from them, by building profiles of the trustworthiness of individuals etc, or requiring collateral.

The notion that a person can be locked up in a government prison for failing to fulfil a private contract is absurd.

Not to mention that the government legal system is broken and inaccessible to begin with.

If the world managed to kick central banking, and adopt a sound money (like Bitcoin) for example, as well as kick government out of the business of enforcing private contracts, most of the worlds societal problems would be solved.",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wul5nf/who_are_dumber_anarchists_who_dont_understand/ilf20hc/,Capitalism

Why would capitalism get voted back in? Its because this nonsense central planning that always goes hand in hand with socialism just doesnt work and people crave the free market.

They're not productive assets.

That's nonsense. Where would you get that idea.  They produce comfort and style and protection which aids in the wearer producing other things.  You want to draw a shaky line at comfort and fashion? You'd have a system which would spend all the resources of society, just trying to keep track of and enforce anytime people start using their ""personal possessions"" as productive or capital assets.

&gt;What private ownership of the productive assets and profit incentive throughout history has shown us is that privately owned organisations are willing to do incredibly violent things to secure more resources in countries that have less regulation and less legal enforcement. 

That's not even remotely true. Your thought process is borne of refusal to learn economics and political economy, thus you don't understand how state power created the outcomes you observe in history (either directly or via unintended consequences and negative externalities).

&gt;Many common brands are guilty in directly orchestrating horrid violence for just that; and they get away with it because there are no enforcement agencies strong enough who are willing to prosecute them meaningfully.

This is what happens when you have a state, and it is poor at producing justice, legal rules, and property rights enforcement.  This is a function of government crowding out markets for these things.

&gt;The solution is not less regulation and less enforcement. That makes no sense, right?

Not linearly, no. Government interventions occur in layers (a heuristic process of mitigating the unintended consequences of prior layers, with new layers).  Often if we ""deregulate"" partially, we expose consumers and citizens to worse underlying problems. But the root of all those problems is usually in the existence of the state and the failures which had built up.

&gt;I am all for freedom and autonomy but unjustified hierarchies perpetuated by private ownership and profit incentive do not nurture freedom and autonomy - they actively oppose and destroy it.

You can't define (or even if you could, you couldn't practically enforce) what are unjustified hierarchies.

The opening up of the trade possibility frontier is also great for utilization of economies of scale and also conflict prevention which is another major reason for food wastage.

Roughly, capitalism requires the ability for capital investment, and that's mostly the defining feature of the system.

Capitalism has a limited definition for economists. It is not broad and all encompassing. Technically no society uses capitalism in its limited definition. Besides perhaps states trading with other states. 

Capitalism is able to distribute any resource efficiently due to subjective prices. This means that while the selling sets prices, so does the buyer as well. The easiest example is in the case of auctions. But for readily available goods this tends to be unnecessary in most markets.

Say we have two farmers and two plots of land. They use themselves and their families as labor. And they have a bunch of gold to trade. One farmer lives in the hills, the other in the plains. The hills farmer breeds livestock as the environment is not suitable for crops. Whereas the plains farmer grows crops. This is because of the costs and revenues of the expected businesses. The hills farmer can lose money trying to grow unsuitable food in such a harsh climate. Whereas the plains farmer knows he can make a lot of money growing the right crops for the climate. 

Because of market prices, they know when to grow. Selling their crops at high prices. And storing during low prices. Because they know the price of the cost of doing business, and the expected prices on the market they know what business they should conduct in a given time frame. They seek the highest profit margin because that is what the market consensus is signalling to the farmers. This defends them from risks of drought, and so on. Ventures that lose them money or have slimmer margins are less efficient. Unless specialization means they are better off not switching. 

The key really is prices. The Silk road in ancient times delivered goods including food from one end of the world to the other with only the knowledge of prices. Traders could determine their costs, the revenue and risks involved and decide to go make the journey or not. No one knew what China was like, and no one knew what Europe was like. This means that the food will flow to the place with the highest prices with all else being equal. 

Food waste: There are pretty ridiculous statistics on food waste. The entire world could benefit from being less wasteful. 

Capitalism also has incentives for less waste. Just like before as a farmer or a chef we look to improve our margins or profit. The way to do this in terms of waste is to waste less resources. Wastage is an important accounting figure. Determining how to reduce waste can improve our profit margin. Making us more competitive and keeps us from switching to a more profitable business with higher margins. A great example is Mc Donald's. They have done a lot of work to be as efficient as possible. Everything is standardized, bought in bulk, sold off quickly, kept clean, transported efficiently, grown to their standards in order to reduce the cost of a meal. To do that all yourself would be extremely expensive. 

There is a paper about making a toaster from scratch that explains this famously. 

In summary. Prices are the most efficient means to gather consensus on what to do in a market economy. With zero price interference, we have the most efficient market. In reality all modern markets have interference. But that is a separate topic regarding your question. Prices means we don't need to know everything to efficiently allocate resources.",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wuuaw4/capitalism_and_food_distribution/ilcsgdx/,Capitalism

&gt;Hello, Im new to economics and would like to know if Capitalism is capable of efficiently distributing food better? 

A sort of implicit assumption in this question is that all the food just exists as communal property and the problem is figuring out who should get the food and how. Its also detached from what distributing means in the case of non-capitalism, which means the government putting a gun to a food producers head, through the threat of jail, and taking his food to give to others according to whatever the government workers feel is best. 

Another is the standard. Efficiency at achieving what goal? Distributing food better for what goal?

Now if you believe that there are any form of market failures, which capitalism cannot overcome on its own, then and then only, the reason for the existence of State comes in. That is the only reason why the capitalist idea might permit state.

I believe that market failures don't exist and given enough time market correct itself more efficiently than the states could ever do. But your assessment may vary.

So, if you believe in market failures then you have to support the existence of State. And if you want a state then it has to be democratic, as it is by far the most efficient form of government. (China had one child policy, and it was a big failure)

If you, like me, believe that there are no market failures then logically you have to support stateless society. Alternatively you can, be little dishonest and also argue for minimal form of government.

We have a responsibility to our species to contribute positively and not suck the life out of the land and each other; which is why I think that it is such a stupid, risky bet to expect private owners who are incentivized by profit to have unregulated access to the land and not just ramp up the damage they're doing in pursuit of profit. To me, it's akin to letting methamphetamine addicts have unregulated access to a stockpile of meth and expecting them to slow their use to a healthy amount. 

Productive entities are supposed to contribute positively. They're supposed to be regenerative and sustainable. If they were, then we wouldn't have a problem, would we? 

The older I get, the more I continue to see our information sharing, communication channels, and media platforms get more and more corrupted by the same profit-incentive. It's worrying. It has me unable to justify bringing children into the world because at this rate, what's it going to look like when they're my age. These private owners have even compromised our democracy; so between that and the state of mainstream media, how are we supposed to fix it without doing something that people like you would consider extremism? To think that our economic system is separate from our political system is naive. It's profitable to control politics and profit is the incentive, so the politics is controlled.

What's the solution, in your eyes? Do you even see a problem? What do you believe are the most pressing issues of today, and do you think that anybody is doing anything meaningful about them?.",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wul5nf/who_are_dumber_anarchists_who_dont_understand/ilbzryt/,Capitalism

Trade exists within capitalism, but trade exists within socialism as well as most other socio-economic systems, too.

Capitalism is identified by the private ownership of productive assets (the means of production) and profit-incentive.

In order to have both notarized ownership of these assets like factories, land, machinery etc, and enforcement of contracts, you need government. 

We can skip around and pretend that an ancap society has no government because they do not call it government; but that doesn't make the organisation responsible for enforcing contracts and validating ownership claims not government.

It is an organic part of the entire product distribution relationship in society. It is also an organic part of the entire production relations of society. Taxes are collected by the state, and the main body exercising the right to collect tax is the state, which is the best and most effective form for the government to obtain fiscal revenue.  
  
Meaning of tax:  
Taxation is a normative form in which the state participates in the distribution of social products in accordance with its social functions and in accordance with legal provisions, and obtains fiscal revenue compulsorily and free of charge in order to meet social public needs.  
  
(1) Taxation is a tool, the purpose of which is to obtain fiscal revenue for the state, so as to meet social and public needs;  
  
(2) The tool of taxation is mastered and used by the state, so the right to levy tax belongs to the state;  
  
(3) The performance of taxation is to transfer the income of taxpaying units and individuals to the government through compulsory collection in accordance with the provisions of the law to form fiscal revenue.  
  
The function of taxation:  
It refers to the inherent function of the objective existence of taxation. The function of taxation is determined by the essence of taxation, and it is the embodiment of the essence of taxation. Three basic functions of taxation: financial function, economic function, supervision function.  
  
Economic function, also known as adjustment function (adjustment), refers to the balance between total social demand and total supply through tax distribution.  
  
The supervision function involves both the macro level and the micro level, and supervises the economic operation and the production and operation activities of taxpayers.  
  
The fiscal function, also known as the revenue function, refers to the function of taxation to obtain fiscal revenue (over 90%) for the country by participating in the distribution and redistribution of social products and national income.  
  
Tax principles:  
Taxation principles are the basic guiding ideology and basic rules that the government should follow when formulating taxation systems and performing taxation functions. They are the theoretical standards and guidelines that should be followed in taxation management. They are the reflection of certain social and economic relations in the construction of the taxation system. The taxation relationship adapts to the requirements of a certain production relationship, and it embodies the basic idea of the governments taxation.",comment,/r/Capitalism/comments/wt3ucs/what_is_your_view_of_taxation/il9stxg/,Capitalism

whats more is he has started wearing eyeliner and painting his nails, which he says makes him feel amazing and we are all so glad to see him happy in his own skin after so long... but if his family ever finds out he would be in a world of trouble.

someone ive been kind of flirting with for a while now invited me to stay the night at their place a while ago and it was very clear it was for sex, and i felt okay about it at the moment, but then when i started to think about it too much i freaked out and ended up calling a raincheck. well that person would like to cash in said raincheck this week and i dont know what to do. 

i feel like i should want to have sex with them, and i should do it when i have the opportunity, but i just dont think i want to? its difficult. i feel like im trying to prove something to myself but i also dont want to put myself in a situation that would be embarrassing for me. its been so long i fear ill just make an ass out of myself anyway because im so rusty. basically, i just fear that i will humiliate myself because im bad and undesirable and just make myself anxious.

But I have a nametag with my full name on which I was wearing yesterday and one of the newer employees asked me which was my name. I explained one was a nickname and one was my full name.

I answer, trying not to get annoyed (I  am not fond of being called the maculine form of my name.

Below is just a few of the many things I'm struggling with, to do with what they've said in regards to me as a neurodivergent, proud LGBTQIA+ human bean.

They have constantly told me that if my chosen degree isn't in a field I can work in, then it's a total waste of time essentially. I wanted to do a degree in the arts and then specialise in my chosen practical field after, but nope, still not good enough.

They've made a huge issue out of calling me by/referring to me by my preferred pronouns, which are they/them/theirs. My father has told me that he will always see me as his daughter.... (I'm a 27 NB human bean). My step-mother has said they refer to me as she/her to their friends, as to them, she is they, and they is she, even though I asked them not to do this.

One of my very best friends is NB, and while they will accept she/her, they prefer they/them. I accidentally hecked up and said she/her when referring to them, and my parents brought it up, being like, there you just did it too!!!... (It was not on purpose at all, and I was like ""she, sorry, they...."", correcting myself, even though my friend was nowhere nearby).

They've made the old joke of the fact the English language isn't constructed that way, as well as that when I had a huge trauma meltdown a few years ago when they came over from Canada to see me (I'm in Australia) as well as do other things also, while on the trip.  The trauma meltdown was so bad that I had to go home and end our portion of the trip early, because I hate being hugged a certain way, and occasionally hugged at all due to sensory stuff, and my father wouldn't respect it, so I had to go home, and my father was really upset about this, they both told me he shed many tears over it. They were so pissed off that I apparently didn't want to bust my gut to be with them, although I was so mentally unsafe and not fit to be outside. (I stupidly apologised to my father for how it made him feel, and he was like, apology accepted. In my head, I was like no, I'm sorry for how my actions may have been misunderstood, I am not sorry for what happened). 

I have pretty severe ADD, a sensory processing disorder &amp; likely also autism. I am HORRIBLE at remembering stuff when it comes to remembering dates and birthdays (I acknowledged that I understand how it might come across and I apologized for how my actions made them feel) especially when it comes to people I don't feel comfortable around, like family members I don't feel mentally safe around (in this case my so called parents). I tell them happy birthday when I remember to actually say it, and to my memory, they get funny if I don't do it on the actual day, and such (calendars don't help me), but a day or so either side.

They said that they'd *NEVER* do that to me, because I'm apparently always on their minds.

They said they don't expect any better from me anymore, also essentially told me I'm a disappointment, and that my life is a mess, and that because they're both in their 60's, they know more than I do, as well as me being seen as a child.

Not to mention I've been accused SO many times of lying about my chronic health issues, that it's actually stupid, as well as essentially being told that I lie about a lot of things, as well as them essentially saying I have Munchausen's (I know it's a serious Disorder that's valid, and I in NO way mean to cast judgement or a crappy vibe onto the condition, as well as the people who suffer with it), and I've also been accused of Hypochondriasis. That's not even the worst of it. 

They just admitted also, that they're far right wing. They said making the transition to more left wing, is hard for them, which I would be able to maybe potentially accept if they were trying. But their blatant transphobia, and gaslighting, bullying and general derogatory comments towards me, is evidence that they're not capable of changing, and it's also evidence they don't intend to.

I've never felt so alone and borderline worthless. I have a psychologist and she's amazing but I'm really struggling. I have an appt with her soon, and I'm safe, but I feel so close to snapping and losing my collective 

I bring up their behaviour and how it makes me feel, they tell me not to bring up behaviour from years ago, they make me feel less than for bringing up their comments about my pronouns and new chosen name which they made a couple weeks or months ago, then they proceed to bring up the trauma meltdown incident that I mentioned above, and make me feel like absolute trash, which happened like ~5 years ago.

I'm starting to emotionally shut down and badly. Really really badly. I don't feel safe anywhere anymore and if I go no contact with them, I will have no parental figure in my life to lean on for support if I were to need it. I'm so scared. 

I posted here because even though it's online, this is probably the only group I feel comfortable enough to talk to anyone in right now. I'm bawling my eyes out to the point that my pillow is absolutely soaked (I'm laying in bed which is my safe space for when I'm not mentally well).

First of all possible trigger warning, mentions of abuse

Ive been thinking about this for a while and I thought I should ask this community to get an outside opinion.

So heres some context:
My ex physically, emotionally and mentally abused me for 2 years. He held knives against my skin, choked and hit me in public, and only ever complimented me on how skinny I was. Even after I told him I was anorexic.

He has aspd and used that to excuse a lot of his behaviour. Such as saying the n-word and f-slur. Often directed towards me, with the excuse that we need to say it to take away its power and meaning. Despite the fact as a member of the lgbtq+ community, I told him I was uncomfortable with him using the f-slur. 

He would often go on tangents about trans people, asking me things like when someone says they want to cut off their arm they have to go to therapy and society looks down on it. but when trans people want to cut off their tits or dick, we just accept it?
And I always tried politely educating him, but he clearly just wanted an argument and didnt want to learn. 

There was a time when he changed his instagram meme account to a satire non-binary account. He changed his pronouns to they/them and had a piccrew pfp. I asked him if he was really non-binary, and he said he was. I was a little upset he announced it on instagram before discussing it with his partner, but I said I would respect his pronouns. A few minutes later he messaged me back and said he was doing it as a joke. I was extremely upset and offended and told him this. As someone who has questioned their gender for so long, it irritated me and made me feel like I wouldnt be valid in experimenting with they/them pronouns because he would make fun of me. 

I asked him to change it, and he refused. For months.

After we broke up (and I finally blocked him after he threatened to kill himself) he started talking with someone I know. He posted photos of frogs and mushrooms and changed his pronouns on insta to he/they and his name to hex/alex (which SUCKS because alex was the nb name I was going to change to)

So now Im wondering (because I still talk about him to my psychologist, and people who I confide in about the abuse) do I have to respect his pronouns?

Do I have to respect the pronouns of the person who tormented and didnt respect me for years? It feels wrong to. It makes me so angry thinking about it, but I believe anyone can express their gender however they want. And I feel like Im undermining this ideology by not respecting him.  

Please help!.",selftext,/r/lgbt/comments/wwctgo/do_i_have_to_respect_the_pronouns_of_my_exabuser/,lgbt

I think it's a fair question. After all, if there are trans exclusionary radfems, there must be trans inclusionary radfems, and there are. But radical feminism is indeed a mess. So I wrote up the following response, but it took me so long that the thread got locked before I could post it. I figured it might still be of interest to some people, so here you go!

As confusing as it may sound, a radical feminism is not feminism combined with radicalism. It is a specific strain of feminist thought that frames sex as the primary mode of oppression, more than race, class, etc. ""Radical"" here means ""root"" or ""fundamental"". It relies on bioessentialism and has led to a lot of shitty ideas that decent feminists have been stamping out for decades. It overlooks and downplays other axes of oppression, leading to focusing on the interests of white middle class women. They often wouldn't work with organizations they perceived as male-dominated (which I can understand, but it wasn't pragmatic).

Shitty ideas include:
-transphobia, especially transmisogyny (I imagine you knew that though)
-lesbian separatism (less solidarity is a bad thing actually)
-biphobia (I don't understand why they're like this tbh)
-arguing racism and class conflict will go away once patriarchy is defeated (more female oppressors is not liberation)
-working with the right wing to censor porn (I won't discuss whether porn is good or bad for society, but outlawing it won't do women much good and it's not worth shaking hands with conservatives)
-encouraging the law to crack down on sex work (many sex workers are not doing it by choice, but stopping sex work by criminalizing sex workers only hurts them)

I'm sure there's more but that's what I can think of at the moment.

Radfem has been contested by Marxist feminism (and its friends socialist feminism and anarcha-feminism), Black feminism, womanism, transfeminism, and intersectional feminism. These schools of feminism have done a lot more for us.

I once thought I was a trans woman but I am starting to accept the fact that I just saw women and feminity the wrong way. My perception was that men are tough and women are supportive, so my mind went to thinking that because I am a supportive, enthusiastic and loving type I am a full-blown woman trapped in a man's body.

In reality, I never really allowed myself to like being a boy because of the association with this box I was stuck with. The thought that I have to marry a girl and be the man of the house. But after getting aroused by more femboys than women, I realize that I actually want to be a boy in a dress.

Moxie from Helluva Boss really validates me with how he is portrayed as feminine but still a man and, in fact, a husband. He is a straight male bottom and that alone makes me feel really great inside to see than Angel Dust who, bless his icon heart, is a gay femboy stripper and not just a regular guy who's a bottom with a wife.

The image above has been filling with me with so much euphoria whenever I look at it. The dress alone is pretty and precious, but the way he is holding his arms back and looking bashful shows more of how I 1) want to be seen and 2) want to feel as the bride.

As for relationships, I see men sexually and want to marry a man as my husband while I am his wife, even if I'm not binarily female. I want to cook for him, kiss him on the cheek when he's home, and please him on the bed. This occured to me when there were three guy crushes, with one being already married with a kid. However, when he and I were walking his 1-year-old to the creek I wanted to show them, I felt so happy at the idea that we had or adopted that child and that I had a husband and kid.

However, with women, I am romantic or platonic. I seek emotional companionship and physical affection from them. My mind is at peace whenever I am held in someone's arms I trust and feel safe with. I want to have sleepovers with women, have girl talks, go shopping and have them do my nails, etc. It makes me feel overjoyed that, in a safe space, girls would offer me their nail polish for me to try on.

Of course its purely hypothetical, and you cant choose. But if you were to have a child, and at birth you were given the choice for your child to be gay or straight. What would you do?

When I think about my own upbringing, it was a hard hard time. Despite having good parents, I has a huge internal struggle with everything. Even now that Im more comfortable with myself, I feel like life is objectively harder (even if only the little things) as a queer person. However despite all that, being gay has really made me who I am today, and it really is a great thing in so many ways. I saw someone describe it as a unique corner of the human experience and I think thats beautiful. 

Ultimately I would probably make them straight, I want my child to have an easier time than I did, in whatever way I can. To pose a second question though, if you know at birth or before birth, your child will be gay, but your given the opportunity to make them straight, would you? Now to that I really do not know.

Im interested to see your answers, my friend and I spoke for like an hour on this, really made me reflect a lot on my life lol

Well to start off for a while now I've been having sexual dreams about men, and mostly about men. And I have some thoughts of doing things with men. For example i have a friend who had expressed that he's down to have try something. And as of recently I've been thinking about that. Yesterday I was in the car with him and for some reason I thought about just doing him right then and there, but I dont think hes attractive. Same goes for random men I see at work, i can acknowledge when a guy is attractive but i dont feel anything. I also dont think about being in a romantic relationship with men. I always get flustered when a cute girl talks to me, but not with men. Also when I watch porn, naked men just dont do anything for me, unlike women. It's just I have thoughts about doing something sexual with men, but never finding them physically or romantically attractive.

At the hotel one day, the rest of my family were at the restaurant there, leaving my little brother (I won't say his exact age for privacy reasons but he is well under 10 years old, so emphasis on the little.) and I alone in the hotel room.

We were on the bed as I was scrolling through YouTube on the hotel room TV trying to find something to watch, when he suddenly asked me a question.

**""Did you know, girls can marry girls?""**

Now this definitely took me by surprise (albeit a pleasant one), and for good reason. He has never heard of same-sex relationships, at least to my knowledge he hasn't. My family couldn't have taught him because, well, conservative. My best guess is, since he spends pretty much all day on his iPad playing Roblox and watching YouTube videos, he probably learned it from somewhere there.

Still, no matter how curious I was on how he realized that, I wasn't about to do all the hostile ""wHeRe dId yOu LeArN ThAt fRoM?"" stuff. Instead, I replied simply,

""Yes, I know that, they obviously can.""

""How do they do that?""

Of course, no one can blame him for asking that, since before he learned, he most likely thought only a man and a woman can get married. Since I'm secretly trying to protect him from homophobia for as long as I can, I felt a bit tempted to give him a whole speech about how love is love and you should accept everyone. Remembering how much of a free-spirited kid he is, hating anything that even remotely resembles a lecture, I decided to keep it simple.

""Well, they just do.""

Naturally, his next question would be,

""What about boys? Can boys marry boys?""

I was about to give him an enthusiastic, ""Of course! Just like guys marry girls, guys can marry guys and girls can marry girls, there's nothing wrong with that.""

At that moment, it hit me just how risky even having this conversation with him was. He is an extremely talkative boy, so he might feel excited and want to tell his parents what he learned. When they would inevitably get angry and ask where he learned this from, then... all the blame would go to me for being a bad influence. It doesn't help that I'm the golden-child-turned-black-sheep of the family, and I had a disastrous coming out to my parents a year ago. But that was a whole other nightmare.

If I tried to tell him to keep this conversation a secret, that might trigger a reverse psychology thing, so he would tell them anyway. Our parents have always forbidden us from keeping sibling secrets and encouraged tattling, because they're the type who just need to know every single thing about their child and what they're doing, whether we're comfortable with it or not. He doesn't realize how dangerous being different or even just holding different opinions in our family is, bur why would he? He's an innocent little kid who knows no better than to love his parents, no matter what twisted ideologies they feed him.

Anyways, my little brother was still eagerly awaiting an answer, so I had to say something quick.

""Um, yes.""

I didn't sound nearly as confident or sure as I should've.

He laughed a little and looked at me with this smile; I couldn't tell whether it was a happy smile or a bro-are-you-trying-to-joke-with-me-rn smile. He then said,

""Are you serious?""

This makes me think it was most likely the latter, and I screwed up a perfectly good teaching opportunity.

On a side note, one or two years ago he literally told me, my other brother and my mom proudly, ""I like boys!"" Of course, he could only have meant liking boys in a friendly way, or a kiddie crush at most since he was only little, but I still thought he was lucky that my mom just brushed it off as a kid thing.

At the end of the day, no matter who he starts liking when he gets a little older or what I tell him, my parents will still make him conform to the whole one-man-one-woman thing when the time comes.

So, until then, I guess I'll just enjoy looking at him being the innocent, goofy, annoying kid he is.",selftext,/r/lgbt/comments/wvw1yb/i_tried_to_tell_my_little_brother_what_being_gay/,lgbt

I'm reading a book called ""Bad girls"", written by a transgender woman. It's fiction, but it has some of her biographical memories about how she had to be a prostitute in Colombia as a travesti to survive and accept herself in the way. The characters are a group of people that only call themselves ""travestis"". My mom is reading the book also and has read more of it than I, and she says she doesn't understand why they are not transgender. I explained her that, as far as I know, you are a travesti if you consider yourself a man (in this case) but like to dress up as the opposite gender. That's when she said to me ""But except one of them, all consider themselves as women, they don't change back at all, one of them even had a surgery"". I investigated but I couldn't find something that could clear it up for me. I concluded that maybe that was the term they used before and was acceptable 30 years ago, or that maybe the author didn't know the terms, and that's when I found out she was a transgender woman.
So I'm sure I'm missing something, maybe both terms have more of a gray area than I thought, or I don't understand the differences correctly.

I on worked the night shift. There were about 6 of us that worked nights and we were a pretty tight group. Since after the bar rush the place would be all but empty until the morning shift we all got to know each other pretty well. Most of us would even go bowling Sunday mornings after work. Mainly because it was one of the few places you could buy alcohol on a Sunday morning, but bowling was fun too.

A new guy started working there with us. I was pretty excited because I was the youngest one in the group and he was about my age, so yay new friend, right? I tried the usual get to know you small talk with him, as you do, but I got nothing back from him. He wouldn't say much more than a polite hello or similar short or one-word answers. 

He did talk to one of the older waitresses, so one day when I was on break with that waitress I asked her why he wouldn't talk to me at all. I was genuinely concerned that I offended him at one point or something. She then explained how he was gay and the reason he didn't want to get close to anyone is that he got burned by nearly everyone in his life after he came out.

You have to realize that at this time, coming out was a pretty new concept. Sure it had been around by that point but it wasn't something you heard about happening in a small northwest town like the one I grew up in. It was a pretty new concept for me, while I wasn't completely ignorant of it I've never met any openly LGBTQ+ person before, so it was new to me.

Being a latchkey kid raised by the TV with Captain Planet, PSAs, and ""Very Special Episodes"", I was raised to be very open and understanding about things like LGBTQ+. I don't know a better way to put it, but the whole situation made me sad. Sad that even though I wanted to be this person's friend I couldn't because he was scared to get even a little close to anyone. 

Right then and there, I became a full supporter of what would become known as the LGBTQ+ community and Pride movement. Unfortunately, he only worked with us for a few weeks, and I never did get to know him. To this day, I still wonder if that was a friendship I missed or maybe even more after accepting what my own sexual identity is.

Now more than 25 years later, I feel that sadness again. The difference now is that I'm now the one who is too scared to get too close to anyone. Not because of the hate and oppression from the anti-LGBTQ+ bigots, but from hate and oppression coming from the LGBTQ+ community itself. 

The core of the LGBTQ+ movement has always been about acceptance. It's been about ending the hate and oppression so that everyone, no matter what their life choices are, will be accepted as an equal part of our society. 

LGBTQ+ community just isn't about that anymore. It's about spearing as much hate and oppression as possible, and I'm not for that. After fighting so many years for equality it's just so sad that the people I've been standing with have now turning on each other. The ignorance coming from many members of the community is appalling.

The worst part is I know I'm not alone feeling this way, but no one is willing to call people out for their hypocritical bullshit out of the fear of being canceled by their own. To be honest the situation is way worse than it's ever been. When you are too scared to share your opinions with your allies, then there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole system.

The current behavior of the community is going to garner swift and harsh backlash from the right and when it does, decades of fighting and sacrifice will be for nothing. I don't want to go back to hiding my true self for my safety, but I'm prepared to do it if I must. I've done it before for a good part of my life and I can do it again if I have to. 

I simply cannot allow myself to support hate groups and unfortunately, that's exactly what the LGBTQ+ community has become, a hate group. Yup, it's an unpopular opinion and I know I'll get all types of hate for this, but I can't let that change my mind. I'm not afraid of hate, I've had hate thrown at me for most of my life, and I'm pretty much used to it by now. It's just one more group of ignorant haters.  

So I'm just going to sit back and hope that a new movement arises that doesn't accept hate, oppression, and ignorance as appropriate behavior. I wrote this in hopes that others that feel the way I do know that they are not alone. I know some people still stand for the core beliefs of the LGBTQ+ community. I hope this will inspire those people to stand up for what they believe in and not feel like they have to support a group that is oppressing them and others.

I hope thats okay and if not, please delete the post. Thank you so much in advance, I just need to get this of my chest. :)

That being said, here is more to my 'situation'. A couple of months ago, I (f) met a girl in college.  During one of the first time we really talked to each other she immediately asked me if I wanted to go out for a drink with her to talk about classes. I didn't suspect anything, although I thought it was pretty forward. During our first meeting not in college context, one of the first questions she asked if I had a boyfriend or girlfriend. I thought that was pretty weird and thought maybe she is into me. We met a couple of times after that as well and we became good friends. We even texted nearly daily or at least every couple of days and she always asked how my day was etc., so I had the impression she really wanted the conversation to keep going. Some weeks ago she 'found out' I was also into girls during a game of never have I ever (I'm usually not shy about that, but I didn't had the chance before to open communicate my sexuality). Everything was fine until a few hours later when she asked me about my sexuality, which was pretty random because I didn't even know that she was referring to my answer in the game. 

After that we texted a couple of days but she suddenly stopped replying. She asked me about my day and then I replyed 'how was your day' and didn't even answer this. I normally don't think something is off when someone doesn't reply to me, but giving our situation it was only shortly she knew for certain about me being queer and that she always responded and asked questions, I thought something was off. Some weeks went by and she asked if we can meet us the next week. I agreed and asked when, but she didn't responded again. I asked her a couple of days later and she said she has a lot of time, but after I suggested something she was like 'I have to see if that works for me since I have to do a couple of things'. She also knows that I will be moving away after this week, so we probably won't see each other again.

I know that I probably think too much about this and I really tend to be an overthinker, but something tells me something is off. I don't know if it's because she knows I'm queer or if I did or said something that made her feel uncomfortable, but I'm kind of disappointed in her behavior, since it changed a lot. I know that noone can tell me whats going on since nobody knows anyone of us, but isn't that situation kind of weird? Should I ask her about it or just leave it like this?

In 7th grade (August) I met someone who means the world to me. I just switched to my cousins (Lani F, Lun M, my older cousins. and squeaker the younger) school and they were pretty popular. I sold candy to make money. I wasn't very well known I was really just strictly business. One day this girl (who were gonna call dove bc that's my nickname for her) bought 10$ worth of candy and then invited me to hang with her and her friends. I was in 2 of her classes so we were kinda bound to meet sometime. The more I hung out with her the more I fell in love. She was semi-popular for getting told that people like her for her looks. As an Asexual I really couldn't care less about her looks. 

&amp;#x200B;

We ended up sharing common in shows and art. We draw together and became inseprable. I told my best friend of 10 years that I was smitten for this girl. She wasn't very on board with the idea of me in love with a girl because her parents and very strict (to an extent) and her parents would cut us off of eachother until the next time we met. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time skip to October. My mom pulls me out of the school because one of my cousins told her what I was like at school (this cousin was a blabbermouth younger so yea). Dove was openly Bisexual and even had a pride backpack. Before I left school I hugged her, she kissed me on the cheek. Then me and my cousins walked up the hill to get to my moms car. My older cousins pressured the younger cousin to not say a word. But as one of my cousins Lun was talking about this girl he'd met squeaker couldn't help himself but blab about my kiss on the cheek. I was screwed. I never gone back to that school. I was pulled and put in online. I lost Dove, I lost my friend group, and lost my income. (I was making bank) and I cried like hell. I was broken.

&amp;#x200B;

In November I was able to find dove again. I we went back to what we were doing and were planning on things we were gonna do once we reunited. We drew what we wanted to do. What we wanted our future after we graduated school. My mom found out in January of that year. She was ruthless, insulting a minor. I vented to my friends a lot so they had pent up agression from me venting about my mom being terrible to me. Calling me slurs and making comments on my apearance. They weren't scared to fight back against my mom. Dove wasn't afraid of what we had. She had no shame until my mom started calling them the gay slur. It's sad that it happened and it felt terrible. My mom to my bestfriend's mom and my bestie thought I picked dove over her. She hated me so much, she said the gay and black slur in hatered for my soul. She even called me a ""weirdo"" because I like a girl. I was hurt by this comment. We were able to rekindle the friendship but I'm scared of screwing up because I was hurt after her comments before.

&amp;#x200B;

I cried for days on end after my best friend of 10 years betrayal. I was hurt. I was what felt like stabbed in the back. Thank god I met Dove. She stuck with me throught thick and thin. no matter what anyone said she and I were gonna stick by eachother's.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder sometimes if I'm a bad person for staying with Dove. I love her and she loves me but my bestfriend thinks I was being an ass for even being with her.",selftext,/r/lgbt/comments/wvhiqk/i_wish_i_was_free_tw_homophobiapanphobiaracisim/,lgbt

Now on to sexuality this has to be the hardest for me I think I could be Abrosexual and have been identifying with it for a while but with the same a Gender fluid I haven't been feeling the switch again and I feel like i'm just taking up space and I feel hella bad about it could someone please help? any advice I should take? this has been bothering me for months and I really just want help from others that are a lot more experienced than me.",selftext,/r/lgbt/comments/wveg0v/confused_about_gender_and_sexuality_need_help/,lgbt

I (17 they/them) go to a high school that has a quite large population of trans and non-binary individuals, but recently my school has introduced a new rule that is detrimental.

The rule states that in order for a trans or non-binary person to go by anything but their birth name, they need to get a parent to give a verbal confirmation that they are okay with the name.

Im sure all of you can see whats wrong with this.

Its a rule that will either out someone, or force the individual to go by their deadname and be misgendered FOR THE REST OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL CAREER OR EVEN BOTH.

Me and my friends have created a change.org petition for this issue, but I dont believe Im allowed to post it here. Feel free to stop by in my dms and I can likely give you the link then though ;).",selftext,/r/lgbt/comments/wve0e1/my_school_introduced_an_antitrans_rule/,lgbt

I came to this beautiful country 2 months ago from a very conservative country on a foundation course to transition to a bachelor's in September and I'm in such a state that I haven't been making my rent and my unis fees is due September too.

usually you'd be right to ask me why I don't ask my parents (who are my financial supporters) to support me through this hardship. but,

the thing is, Im bisexual, and my conservative parents got to know that through my brother.

my brother was the only one who was a real friend to me, I feel betrayed, he says it's a mistake, I want to believe him but my heart's too broken, my parents don't talk to me anymore, I'm suddenly the disgrace of the family, they have legitimately threatened me to not tell anyone or they disown me.

I don't know what to do anymore.
I can understand why people get the idea of ending their lives.
I don't even have the emotional capacity to think about my visa ending in the next 2 weeks and my fees pending.

Trans people may use these terms to describe themselves and their transition journey. There are very few situations where referring to the assignment of gender at birth is relevant at all.

Dont use AFAB when you mean:

Women   
Nonbinary people who you view as women/female (some nonbinary people transition)   
People ""socialized female"" aka have lived sometime as people believing they were a girl (some AFAB people socially transition very early)   
People who experience(d) misogyny (that can happen to both afab/amab people)   
People with vaginas (bottom surgery exists)

and vise versa for AMAB people.

&amp;#x200B;

No you arent attracted to AFAB people only. That makes as much sense as me saying I prefer only people born via c-section. Just say you have a preference for vaginas.

Feel free to correct me.  

Im posting because Im so confused about my sexuality and gender identity. I get that these two dont have to go hand and hand, but for me it seems like they are in my head. I have a hard time unblending the two, and I need some help. 

Im 25 now &amp; female was the sex I was assigned at birth. But ever since I was young I was always described as a tomboy. And I actually went through what my mom called a phase (which it wasnt) in middle school and high school where I hated my gender and was certain I wanted to be a boy. It was completely shut down by my mom, and ever since then Ive suppressed the fact that I dont like being a girl. More specifically, I dont feel feminine. I definitely feel masculine, from my appearance down to traditional gender roles. 

The problem (well I guess not really a problem, more so confusion) is that I often fantasize and daydream about women sexually. When I think about it, Im always in a more masculine role and acting like a man I guess. Im taking on more traditional masculine roles like protecting them, being emotionally restrained, dominance, confidence (even arrogance), etc. I was an athlete growing up, and I picture myself as that same tough, rough around the edges &amp; strong kind of person. When I imagine it, I dont see myself having the more intense masculine traits like aggression &amp; assertiveness. Its more so that I am not feminine at all (not emotionally sensitive, sexually modest, docile/fragile, in need of protection, passive, submissive) Idk how else to describe it. And I know that Im probably reading too deep into the gender roles, but unfortunately it was stigmatized in my family and Im left with a very close-minded view of things. 

Anyways, I dont find myself to be physically attracted to women when I see them in person. Or maybe I do and I dont realize it?  I typically find myself to be attracted physically to men, but it makes me excited to think about how I could be more free expressing my gender as a more masculine person in a relationship with a female. I also feel like it would make me fulfilled to take care of a woman &amp; protect her. 

I will add that when I was younger and wanted to be a boy, I was hooking up with this girl for a few months. I dont remember much about it though, likely because I felt so much shame from my mom being dismissive about my gender identity.  

Is it possible that my gender identity is related to my sexuality? If so, how? 

I know that ultimately I need to do what feels right to me, but Im just so confused. I would love some and advice from people that have felt similarly to me.

 He reached out again a while ago n we got back together bc we still had a lot of chemistry. But he's not ace, like sex is an important part of the relationship for him and I totally understand that, so I was doubting our relationship and wondering if we should break up for good and he was rlly nice about it still bc he knows I have trauma about that anyway (dad shit yk) but he wanted me to feel comfortable with having sex. 

I agreed bc I figured well you have to do stuff you don't wanna do for ur relationship but like, idk I just don't think I can get with it. We never had sex before and I can't see how we would now. So I'm also kinda wondering if I'm just not into guys?

Like he's so sweet and cute and we get along pretty well and the cuddling is great. Idk I'm just really confused, I love him but idk if I can do this anymore. I don't wanna lead him on if I can't fulfill his needs but he's convinced we're meant to be together anyway.

I cannot sleep. 

So there are these two terms, and they embody messaging on their own. 

The girl-boss is someone who is using a marginalized identity (usually that identity being a woman) as likeplot armor for shitty behavior. Think capitalist exploitation, white feminism, or scamming people out of money through MLMs. The thing that feels the most egregious about the girl-boss is the abandonment of other marginalized groups in the pursuit of capitalism. 

The alpha male is similar, but represents more aggressive behavior than the girl-boss, and doesnt have the protective shield of marginalization to hide behind while doing asshole things. The alpha male doesnt sell make-up or shampoo in their pyramid scheme, but the supremacy of their identity (usually rooted in masculinity) and how to use said identity for conquest of some kind. Be it for women, money, or status through a combination of both. 

These terms are gendered, but they take on a life of their own in many ways. I feel like anyone can girl-boss, gaslight, gate-keep. I also think that the concept of the alpha male is so absurd that it can also be used appropriately in non-gendered ways when the context is a comically hyper masculine action. 

But even so they are gendered. 

For example, when Im doing manual labor I will joke that was very girl-boss of me but if I wanted to make a similar joke about a male friend I could say that was very alpha of you. Both are a facetious way of acknowledging we did something powerful, but because it wasnt actually harmful, its funny. 

Please tell me you are following.

She's super cute, funny, beautiful and smart. But that's not the point.

The point is that I usually don't appreciate physical touch. It makes me very unconfortable, in a way because I can't make my mind focus on anything else than that at that moment.
And this girl (that I met twice) is super tactile (with me as with anyone). And with her, it's always so natural that I really don't care anymore, I actually really enjoy it.

And it's so rare for me to enjoy touching people that I'm so excited about that, I kinda want to see her more and talk to her more and know about her.

The thing is that I'm also a girl and I really don't know if she's into girls. And the way she acts by touching my hand, my shoulder, leaning her head against mine... She also does it with the other girls.

So I'm in a situation where I'm sort of building my attraction for her on the way she acts with everyone. It's very scary, but I also really really like it. It's scary because there's this very high pourcentage that she's only acting normally, without any ulterior motive. I'm scared of being disappointed.

I met a woman in times of a pandemic through an app for lesbians.  We talked

 A while later she says that she met another older woman and that they started dating.

 We still talked about meeting in person but we went into confinement, she only answered my messages when she wanted to so I walked away, I stopped talking to her.

 She always followed me on Instagram and always kept seeing my stories but not interacting.

 A month ago I decided to start a conversation with her by responding to a video of the city where she lives and which I usually visit from time to time.

 Then she told us to meet when I went there.  After some conversation and some disagreement because she unticked a few times, we met.

 I went without expectations because she told me that her relationship was in crisis.  I just went to meet and laugh.  As soon as we started talking she tells me that she was super down because she cheated on her girlfriend and they ended the relationship.

 I think she makes up some things because what she tells me doesn't add up sometimes.  So, in the meeting, she kept asking if I thought she was a bad person for having cheated, if I would forgive a betrayal, that it's too early for her to get involved with someone else, who would fight for her ex and looking at me watching my reaction.  I just laughed, but responded politely.

 Anyway, we talked about a lot and there were moments when she looked at me with desire.

 The day after we meet, she posts a photo on Instagram with her girlfriend and the caption saying that she misses him and that he is the love of her life.  She made me want to laugh and I pretended I didn't see it.  Clearly she's playing with me.  She wants to play with me or just play psychological games, I don't know but it seems toxic to me.

 I already told her about my intentions, I even asked if she was attracted to me on the date, she said she liked being with me and that she doesn't know if she feels more than that but that we could meet again as friends.

 I felt again that she wanted to play games.  I told her that I wanted to have fun with someone without games and dramas and that when she solved her emotional problems and wanted to meet me we could go out as friends.

 Am I wrong?  Was I right to end contact with her?  Not wanting to be cocky but already being, I'm prettier and more attractive than her girlfriend and she enjoyed my company, do I still have a chance with her?  She told me that she would fight for her ex.. but like I'm way better, that's the truth.  Sorry for the rant.",selftext,/r/lgbt/comments/wv3xsv/if_you_were_in_my_place_would_you_accept_to_be/,lgbt

There are so many sexualities, so take your time looking them up to see if any fit.

You might also find you become interested in a gender based on the gender of your crush/partner.

If it is annoying to think about, you can set it aside, or just pick one until you change your mind.

Going through changes also takes time to adjust, and reflect on how you feel about things.

Best wishes.",comment,/r/lgbt/comments/wwazzr/idk_what_to_think_help_me/illgi2j/,lgbt

It is assumed you are straight so there is no reason to need to communicate that you are but we have reason to communicate that we are not.

If there is a gay couple in a movie then people will talk about it. If there is a straight couple no one bats an eye.

Straight things are everywhere all the time but it is so normalised that people act like it isn't and choose to notice the much lower amount of lgbt stuff instead.

When I was young and first came out I disliked Pride events for the usual reason, overt flamboyance. This lasted well into my twenties until I had gained more knowledge of protest movements and the history of Pride itself. I also began to understand my dislike came from my own shame and it wasn't really until I was more comfortable and proud of myself that I understood the point. By being visible and in your face you create a safe space for our community. Pride is more about us coming together and showing those still in the closet we exist, not about them.

As far as politicians, it doesn't matter what they would do but what they are doing. As long as they are governing in a way to improve our lives and make us safe and equal, we gain the ability to be open in society. The more of us people can see and know the more social attitudes change leading to more politicians being elected who are genuinely allies.

For a while I was very much upset with corporate sponsorship of Pride. I've come to the conclusion that I'm okay with it as long as it doesn't cause us to tame the events. If they can't support us for who we are, they can go. The other condition is, they have to put their money where their floats are.

To some extent, I get it. The magnitude of slash fiction written by straight, cis women can drown out queer voices in the niche.

At the same time, some of these are phenomenal stories written with great tact.

These authors often defend themselves by saying it allows them to pursue approaches to romance and erotica storytelling outside the scope of tropes often required to make a heteronormative story work, by removing something like the strong man/weak woman cliche. 

Generally, though, I conclude that they willingly engage in fetishization at the expense of queer voices. They're also unabashedly unapologetic about it, and often act entitled toward dominating queer fiction.

It's all so very unfortunate, and feels similar to attitudes some straight women have when dominating queer spaces like gay nightclubs.

Im not entirely sure why youre sharing this opinion here. What is it, exactly? That we cause our own problems? With the grammatical errors, the point of this is kind of lost on me. 

Why are we gay? Not all of us are, for starters. Some of us are bisexual, or pansexual, or asexual, or maybe identify as queer. Some people may be none of those things, the spectrum is fairly wide. Some of us are transgender, non-binary, intersex, I meantake your pick. 

Yes, if someone identifies as gay, they are neither heterosexual nor homophobic. I think that should have gone without saying, but why did you feel the need to state the obvious? I mean, further down, you say that you support us, which is all well and good, but I think somewhere inside you are bothered by our community. In order for us to grow as people, we need to pick out those feelings and really take a look at them. Why is it bothering you that we are different? You say that no one cares about that, and yet you felt inclined to make a post here and state those things to us. Anyone that has ever felt the need to state some of the things youve said, has some inner disgust, or prejudice, or hatred that they cover up with false indifference.

Commercialisation of pride though, that's a tricky thing. Sure, pride month has turned in to a holiday season, and like others such as Halloween, Christmas, Easter, it comes with the trimmings. 

Personally, I don't care. I know they're not supporting me, but they sure are empowering and enabling me. More importantly, they are bringing that empowerment to the masses.  

I can't think it can ever been overstated how powerful being seen can be.

You could feel dysphoria but dont have strong hatred of your body and not so much envy for different reasons for example or even just feel feminine instead of masculine and vice versa but feel strongly about it.

Maybe youre a guy that loves t and a and even more that its on your own body, like a possible fantasy that some guys have. Not liking your vagina because you have a disconnect that you should have a penis there instead etc.

Ask yourself what exactly it is that you dont like about your vagina and what causes you to wish you had a penis? 

How you feel about either is important to understand how serious it may be.

- like feeling nauseous at the sight of your genitalia and heavy envy that you should have a penis there instead

- a sense of naturalness with having a penis and a disconnect with having a vagina

These are just two ways to interpret things but there is really no one way things have to be to be considered x or y and its something that youll have to feel through.

Try presenting as a guy if you can for a couple of days or a week and see how you feel about it, if it feels right or if theres something more to it. By presenting you dont need any name change or go by anything different but it is something you could test if you have friends that you can trust that care about you and what youre going through. They could call you by a preferred name for example along with you presenting as a guy/masc.

See if you have gender envy when looking at guys and their bodies especially their genitalia. For me, amab, I have really bad gender envy from just looking at pinterest for art references. It blocks day to day life at times and stops me from going to irl events for fear of triggering that envy. For everyone it is different in severity and triggers from slightly different things but it is a key feeling to feel out when questioning.

Feel out if it could be sex related, like top/bottom etc, if you like the feeling of being dominant or submissive. Even with sex related emotions you can still be a guy and a bottom for example, there is no correct set in stone way things have to be.

Youve been questioning your gender for a few years now which to me seems there is something more to that and all these thoughts/feelings youve been going through.

Feel things out through testing, try presenting generally, see if your friends that you can trust could refer to you by a preferred name and see how it makes you feel etc.

Questioning and coming to terms with who you are can be difficult at times, same goes with sexuality, but theres something so special in finding your true self. The happiness that it can bring you for knowing who you are as a person goes far.

Worldwide and especially in America and Europe, ultra-right, conservative and partly already openly fascist groups are gaining strength. 

It is up to us to lead the fight for a better world, but how can that work without a local network of like-minded people? 

Anti-fascist work (research, outings, actions, planning, visits, etc.) has always had a clandestine character. Not without reason, because our enemies are everywhere! 
Nevertheless, the antifascist movement needs to open up worldwide in order to reach like-minded people more easily and to create a broader network. 

For this reason, you and your group should also organise an Open Antifascist Meeting (OAM).


But what should such an OAM offer? 

First of all, the OAM should offer a platform for exchange and networking among antifascists and other left-wing people. 

The OAMs in my city are organised by motivated people on a self-supporting basis and consist of five parts.

1. exchange among the participants
2. theoretical input on antifascist topics or antifascist work.
3. practical part in the form of a workshop or an action.
4. information on anti-fascist work done and outed fascists in the group area.
5. planning of the next OAM

This is our form of an OAM, how your OAM should take place is up to the participants and can be arranged freely in principle. 


What do you need to hold an OAM?

First of all, you need a room that offers enough space and security.

You should also think about how you can make interested people aware of your OAM. This works well on the internet or through street posters, flyers and stickers.

Last but not least, you should offer some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks so that the interested people are also somewhat fed.


If you live in an area that is already infested with fascists, you should urgently take some protective measures.

Among other things, you should keep the location of the event secret and not advertise it. Instead, list a secure email address on the advertisement through which interested people can register for the OAM. On this registration form, you can then send the address of a lock point in the vicinity, where you can pick up interested people and send them to the event location. 


You should also protect yourselves from state or private repression:

It is best if all participants hand over their smartphones so that you can ensure that no one films or records sensitive content.

 It is also important that you are careful with names etc. to protect yourselves from spies. Only open up to people you perceive as trustworthy.

In general, you should try not to disclose sensitive information about your antifascist work (especially illegal actions) unless you already have a relationship of trust with the people present.

If you have problems with violent fascists in your region, it is advisable to organise a small protection force.



Our OAM has two online chats through a secure provider (Signal). One is the general OAM chat, where all interested visitors can sign in, and the other is the OAM organization chat, where motivated and trustworthy people can be added to plan the next OAM. 

These chats help us to organize and mobilize for upcoming events and actions. 


With this knowledge you should be able to organize an OAM in your place. If you have any questions I will be happy to answer them in the comments.

Well then, to the work comrade!
For a better, antifascist world!.",selftext,/r/communism/comments/wqba7z/why_you_too_should_start_an_open_antifascist/,Communism

What if we could develop a framework where we could demonstrate through social practice that Unity will serve Our interests more effectively than division, that a new and more prosperous way of social life could  be had RIGHT NOW, if only we withdrew from the fascist arrange ment by building Our own Autonomous Infrastructure.

If we make a dialectical materialist analysis of the primary productiveness point in the U.S. fascist arrangement we find it is the workers, the People themselves, who are that productive point.

The basis for many being how the ruling class drove society to ruin and the masses are left to live in the rot.

But while watching Akira, it was like a holy shit moment. The clarity of this is *exactly* where society is heading. 

Schools and infrastructure vandalized and falling apart. No one in the building gives a shit about education.
No structure or order to be found amongst the people. 
A totalitarian police state. 
Hedonistic, hopeless masses. 
Religious cult fanatics publicly demonstrating. 
Anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist protestors everywhere. 
Revolutionaries bombing target areas in hopes of damaging the ruling class.
Students protesting the government are shown beaten and killed on TV while the news casually reports police *clash* with student protesters. We believe there are several casualties  now this as they switch to a cutesy dog news story. 

Its fucking insane. 

The craziest part is seeing how easily we go from where we are now to the society portrayed in Akira. 

Simultaneously, Im grateful that I wont have it as horribly as future generations will, but Im still torn up by my current situation. Im barely scraping by now with the bare fucking necessities. For most of us, just surviving is a monumental and exhausting task. 

One thing this movie did for me is define who the true #1 enemy is: capitalists. 

I use to think the religious were the greatest threat to a healthy society. Then I gave the edge to conservatives as a whole with a special focus on the far-right. But the #1 enemy of a healthy human society is without a doubt capitalists (yes, most religious and conservatives are proponents of capitalism). Im sure many in this sub have already come to this conclusion. 

Worst part is, this feels like our fate. Outside of ET intervention, I cannot fathom any way in which we avoid this type of outcome. 

Im tired and rambling now, so Ill end this.

If you havent watched Akira, I recommend it. You can find it on Tubi and Hulu (dub and sub).

I dont know where the general leanings of this sub are so this post might be redundant but Id like to hear your opinions on this.

First of all: I think for most western countries this is just a thought experiment as our societies seem to have moved so far right in the last 20 years that I think we only have the option to fight when things turn to shit but some eastern asian, african or south american countries might have a chance, from my limited knowledge.

After this lengthy disclaimer:

I think the minds of so many people are so rotten with propaganda and lies that its nearly impossible to teach them in any way. I think a violent way of teaching doesnt work anyway as the people will hate you on the inside and it should not be in our interest to hurt humans, even our enemies, after we won. It can and has been used against us and as I see it was often a strong reason why things failed and got overthrown, ignoring outside agents here for this thought experiment. 
Therefore the only option is teaching the youth and creating a society where the neighbourhood acts like a big-family where everyone teaches one another and shares and whatever, like in a family. Therefore isolating children from their problematic parents without taking them from their homes or creating an outright hostile relationship between parent and child. What we want is to take advantage of the rebellious side of the youth while maintaining the love a child and a parent feel to one another even if their opinions differ. This also has the highest possibility of actually creating change in problematic parents. A highly working educational system would be needed and ofcourse this would not work for everyone as some children will respond more strongly to their parents opinions. I estimate that this system would need about 3-5 generations until a free society could be achieved in which no authoritarian rulership would be needed anymore as the people are educated enough to keep the system running to everyones benefit themselves.


Ofcourse the issue is: how do you make sure that after 5 generations the people in power will either lose it automatically (i dont know how that could work) or give it up out of their own volition?

Again this is a thought experiment or a small brain thinking it has big brain moment. Im interested in your opinions, outlooks and critique!

Here are my views as of yet: Why do you think communism will increase peoples happiness the most, because it seems to me that when we look at China now or the USSR it could never work. The USSR had a very bad economy and quality of life. With communism, people wont work as hard because theres less incentive to, so the economy will go down and society will progress at a much much slower rate. Equality isnt the end goal, we should bridge the gap between poor and rich more because its incredibly unfair that some people are born into much worse opportunities than others, but I didnt think a society could be both completely equal and also happy; its ideal but not realistic at all. The most important thing is increasing overall happiness in a country and communism will just decrease it, maybe even for the poorest people as well. If you disagree, why?

So...more precisely: Does it shine any light on gender **specifically?** Let's take a look at a definition of perfomativity by Britannica:           

&gt;Gender is [constituted](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituted) by action and speechby behaviour in which gendered traits and [dispositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dispositions) are exhibited or acted out. In particular, gender is not an underlying essence or nature of which gendered behaviour is the product; it is a series of acts whose constant repetition creates the [illusion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/illusion) that an underlying nature exists. Gender, according to Butler, is performatively constituted by the very expressions that are said to be its results. She stressed, however, that individuals do not exist prior to or independently of the genders they perform: gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to preexist the deed. Indeed, the doer is variably constructed in and through the deed. Individual identity (the subject) is itself performatively constituted. It follows that individuals do not choose their genders and cannot assume or [discard](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/discard) or radically alter them at will simply by behaving (or not behaving) in certain ways. 

This seems to problematically conflate gender with gender expression and to ignore gender identity, but that's not the point I am pursuing here. To me, this seems to be a very general statement about *active* social roles. Now, what do I mean by active? I mean something which works differently from race, which is stamped on people regardless of whether they ""perform"" or not.        

We can use Hegel, Heidegger and Satre to understand why I think perfomativity is close to saying nothing. Following the latter, for example, I may choose to become a programmer but I am irreducible to being-a-programmer. I am not a programmer in the same sense that a rock is a rock. I am a programmer because I continually choose to incarnate that role and through the course of my free existence I might throw that away. ""Existence precedes essence"", in his terms.                   

On Heidegger:

&gt;The basic idea of ontic guilt \[not relevant here\] is that Dasein \[we can take Dasein to mean ""human beings"" to understand this quote\], **as existing, must** project itself upon a possibility or possibilities of Being of some kind or another. This projection belongs to what it is to exist and is thus constitutive of Dasein's very Being (p. 185). Thus, for example, Dasein can project itself upon the possibility of Being a student or a policeman.      

I do not see how the performativity of gender is distinct from the perfomativity of being-a-teacher other than not being voluntary. Is this the only difference? If this were the case, there would only be a difference of *form of the social role* and no difference of *content of the social role*. This is absurd. To add: as we have remarked, even if gender is not the act of wholesale freedom Satre is talking about, nonetheless it is *active* in the sense we have described before. It must be, otherwise it is not perfomativity. 

Finally, Hegel departs from the more professionalist examples and starts talking about religion. To Hegel religion is not just something I ""believe in"" (that is faith, not religion), it's something I actively embody through my actions in ritual. Someone who doesn't confess his sins and forgives the sins of others who confide in them cannot be called a Christian. In doing this Hegel follows Luther's theology, where sacramental acts cement Christ's presence in earth. To me this is the more dangerous territory for perfomativity theory, because religion (unlike profession) is both an inner conviction that constitutes its subject and cannot be modified/discarded at will and an active engagement of the subject. Converting to another religion or abandoning religion altogether is not something you can just *do* without fundamental changes in your identity. Religion, like gender, also interprets the body in specific ways. Religion seems to be identical with gender in Butler's rather dry definition. We would need to add to it. 

We have not made progress on explaining what 'gender' actually means. We have merely said it's not innate but that it's also involuntary - and being a non-binary trans woman, not particularly enlightening. We are restating what has already been said instead of adding new information.",selftext,/r/communism/comments/wh3l3o/does_butlers_perfomativity_mean_anything_at_all/,Communism

""In August 1920, Russell travelled to Soviet Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the Russian Revolution. He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled ""Soviet Russia1920"", for the US magazine *The Nation*. He met Vladimir Lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an ""impish cruelty"" in him and comparing him to ""an opinionated professor"". He cruised down the Volga on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He subsequently wrote a book, *The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism* about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the Soviet regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds.""

[About his conversation with Lenin:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TK9c-caEcw) 

""I met Lenin in 1920 when I was in Russia, I had an hours talk tte--tte with him. And um, he spoke English much better than you would have expected, the whole conversation was in English. I expected it to have been in German, but I found that his English was quite good. I was less impressed by Lenin than I expected to be. He was of course a great man. He seemed to me a reincarnation of Cromwell, with exactly the same limitations that Cromwell had. Absolute orthodoxy, he thought a proposition could be proved by quoting a text in Marx, and he was quite incapable of supposing that there could be anything in Marx that wasnt right, and that struck me as rather limited. I disliked one other thing about him which was his great readiness to stir up hatred. I put certain questions to him to see what his answer would be, and one of them was You profess to be establishing socialism, but as far as the countryside is concerned you seem to me to be establishing peasant proprietorship which is a very different thing from agricultural socialism. And he said, Oh dear me no, were not establishing peasant proprietorship, he said You see there are poor peasants and rich peasants, and we stirred up the poor peasants against the rich peasants, and they soon hanged them to the nearest tree, hahahaha. I didnt much like that.""

I only know Russell from his work in maths, his association with G. H. Hardy, and the fact that he chaired the India League (an organisation that advocated for Indian independence during British Raj).

Since my days at school, I have been taught that after Lenin's death in 1924, two people were the main figures in the communist movement: Trotsky and Stalin, and that Trotsky was the one closest to Lenin in terms of true communist ideology, and that Stalin was a more violent oposition that decided to get rid of all Lenin's supporters (and Trotsky, in that matter) to become a dictator in USSR.

However, after some researches, I saw this may not be true.

Apparently, from some marxist-leninist sources, I have seen many instances where Lenin criticized Trotsky's thinking, specially in not believing that there could be a revolution in Russia without involving other european countries, and so on. Writing several complaints about Trotsky's figure in general. And, after Lenin's death, there was a voting that massively decided to expel Trotsky from the communist organization, not only Stalin.

After all this, I can see that the situation is not so clear about ""this bad guy"" and ""that good guy"". Therefore, I ask you, was Stalin closer to the marxist-leninist ideology? If so, how do marxist-leninists view Stalin in regard of the amount of killing and brutality (and If this really happened or is another banalization like trotsky and stalin dicotomy stated before) that surrounded his leadership?

TL;DR: Are marxist-leninists fond of Stalin since apparently he was closer to Lenin than Trotsky?

Can it not instead by transferred to a more teaching and educational role post revolution, and instead the actual governance be transferred to a combination of mass organization delegates, and worker councils to elect them? Would that not actually be a more stable, democratic, and less corrupt system that allows for political discussion and differences to develop?

TL;DR: reproduction extracts money from a family unit, capitalism requires most people be workers, therefore we should be paid to produce more workers.

-----

In more detaul, here is my thinking:

1. You are born into an economic system which you are forced to participate in to survive. Legally you must pay taxes on transactions and land ownership - even bartering/trading has tax implications. This must be paid to the government in your countries national currency.

2. This backbone of our economic system is the sale of labour for capital. If you have no wealth (accrued currency, sellable resource) you can always sell your labour. In selling labour you to reap none, or at least a reduced percentage, of the profits for your output in each transaction.

3. So then, an individual born into a family with no generational wealth is becomes a worker. A worker is, within this system, essentially a product from which surplus can be extracted. 

Moreover,

4. Having children is inherently more expensive than not, meaning in doing so more money will exit the financial ""control volume"" of each family's bubble of wealth. Then, we make both the adult members (worker) and child (future worker) more dependant on the sale of labour for money.

5. Under this system, we are counting on the intrinsic reward to be a sufficient motivator. Whole in previous generations, it was possible for the average person to support a large family financially under a single worker. Now it is not, and so the intrinsic reward is not sufficient to encourage reproduction.

Therefore, we should be paid for the generation of additional workers (products), ie, reproduction.

Im wondering if there are some good Marxist takes/literature on this subject. 

Specifically, we were talking about the whole argument of if the Europeans didnt do it, someone else would have. This of course doesnt justify the brutality of colonialism, but it got me thinking of what material and societal characteristics in Europe lead to the seemingly seamless transition into colonialism. For example, I am of the mind that greater Mediterranean world at whole were set up similarly enough 600~ years ago such that if Europe wasnt the dominant power that first contacted the Americas and colonized them, another Mediterranean power to the south or east could feasibly have at least been incentivized to do so (within the context of feudalist/proto-capitalist society). However, I have a harder time believing that a power like China would have done the same in roughly the same time period. This got me thinking of the differences between feudalism/capitalism and the asiatic mode of production (which I admittedly know little about) and was wondering if there was any discussion on this subject worth looking into. 

Ultimately I think this lands more in the historical what-if category than a meaningful material analysis of capital etc., but I think it would be helpful in connecting the dots on what the specific conditions leading to colonialism were to the global influence of neo-colonial capitalism today.

One of the fantasies I have is starting a business as a Doggy Daycare if I won. I wouldn't need the money, I just love dogs and would get bored without something to do. 

Now of course in this hypothetical scenario I wouldn't take my profits, they would go to the employees and the business itself. (I would need to have employees because I couldn't do it all myself.)

What I thought of doing is once everyone is hired, get them together and have them either join an established union or create one of their own (I obviously wouldn't be a member or affiliated with it in any way). 

I would be uncomfortable holding that much power over them and would want them to have some power over me as well.

There wouldn't be a need to strike really, because I would listen to them and treat them well, but it's still a power dynamic and at least with a union they would have some power themselves.

So, would this still be problematic or somehow a bad thing?

As more and more revisionists accept the logic of their denial of the socialist period in China, they will necessarily have to justify it as an advance (or rupture with pre-existing Marxist practice). This involves a revision of Marxs theory of value itself:

&gt; That the authors should accept Sraffas view is disappointing.  But why does all this matter and what has it got to do with China as a socialist country?  Well, the authors explain why they want Sraffas theory of value and reject Marxs.  Its because by itself, the existence of surplus does not prove the existence, or non-existence,of class exploitation, and does not allow to precisely determine the degree of justice and fairness in a given society.  In other words, we can remove the key distinction between Marxs surplus value under capitalism and replace it with a surplus created by the production of commodities, not value.  As the authors say: in our view, whatever the interpretation of this issue, the law of value in its weak sense (my emphasis) applies both to capitalism and socialism.  According to the authors, whether there is surplus value created by the exploitation of labour and appropriated by private capitals is no longer the key difference between the capitalist mode of production and socialism.  What matters is the surplus (not surplus value) and how it is controlled.  The capitalist and socialist modes can therefore be harmonised in the transition to socialism.  This interpretation of the law of value under capitalism enables them to claim that there is no contradiction between state planning and the market economy because both modes can work in harmony to boost the surplus. Or as Deng famously put, It doesnt matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.

The extraction of surplus value is as such, not in contradiction with the transition to socialism. Here is Stalin a century ago:

&gt; Geometry teaches that parallel lines do not meet. But the authors of this remarkable theory believe that these parallel lines will meet eventually, and that when they do, we shall have socialism. This theory overlooks the fact that behind these so-called compartments there are classes, and that the movement of these compartments takes place by way of a fierce class struggle, a life-and-death struggle, a struggle on the principle of who will beat whom?.",comment,/r/communism/comments/wvnuun/socialist_economic_development_a_review/ilg7w18/,Communism

Even NDMLP's opportunism seems to be the same colour with a different shade.

CPI ML Liberation is also a great example of a party which state in its programme, ""recognising the nationalities right to self-determination in *various degrees up to secession* while cultivating a sense of belonging, equality and security in all minority groupings"" and has a history of engaging in genuine democratic struggle in the past. So while the word 'self-determination' is thrown around commonly, more and more of the 'left' is making caveats in its programme to facilitate opportunism. NDMLP's position in that light isn't surprising, though my limited understanding of their struggle and comparing it with other parties engaged in democratic struggle in the same region leads me to believe that their position will only lead to further political deterioration.

A union is good at a few things: they are good at pressuring employers to offer slightly better wages, slightly better benefits, and slightly better conditions of employment.

What unions do not accomplish is a dictatorship of the proletariat over the ownership in where workers have real rights. Unions merely bargain, they don't control.

In a union shop you have to get used to the fact that employers still own you, they still fire you at their will, they still get to ignore 99.9% of what you say. You have zero input into how the business is ran.

He's a good reminder to communists that there are limits to nationalist movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries without a communist party guiding and serving as vanguard for the struggle and imposing limits on liberal nationalists. I'm always reminded of this excerpt from Abrahamian regarding the events surrounding the coup which I hope will serve as some food for thought for anyone interested in this topic:

&gt;Having extended the secret network, the royalist officers worked
to destabilize the government. They supplied weapons to rebellious
tribes, especially the Shahsavens, Bakhtiyaris, Afshars, and Turkomans.
They established contact not only with prominent conservative
clerics such as Ayatallah Behbehani and Ayatallah Boroujerdi, but
also with dissidents from the National Front, particularly Kashani,
Qonatabadi, Makki, Baqai, and Sha'yban the Brainless. They hired
other thugs to carry Tudeh banners and to desecrate mosques. They
also assassinated General Afshartous, the main officer supporting
Mossadeq, and left his badly mutilated body outside Tehran as a
warning to other pro-Mossadeq officers.

&gt;...

&gt;The mutual suspicions between The Tudeh and the National Front
eventually helped to destroy Mossadeq. On August 16, 1953, as the
shah fled from the country, Tudeh crowds poured into the streets,
destroying royal statues, demanding a republic, and criticizing Mossadeq
for not acting decisively enough. In some provincial towns,
Tudeh demonstrators occupied municipal buildings and raised red
flags. It appeared as if the royalist defeat had become a communist
rather than a nationalist victory. **The following day, Mossadeq, at the
urging of the American ambassador, instructed the army to clear the streets of Tudeh demonstrators. Moreover, the organs of the National
Front declared in their early-morning issue that the danger from the
shah had ended but the danger from the communists loomed large
and would destroy the nation unless promptly stamped out**. As the
army moved into the streets, the Tudeh leaders informed Mossadeq
by phone that their military sympathizers had evidence to prove that
the royalist officers had conspired to use the premiers instructions
to reestablish law and order as a cover to overthrow the National
Front. They also urged Mossadeq to form a broad alliance and to
appeal to the nation over the radio to resist with arms the impending
coup detat. Mossadeq, however, replied that such action would lead
to mass bloodshed.
Rejected by Mossadeq, the Tudeh failed to act against the coup.

And of course the debates within the Tudeh on how they should approach Mosaddegh and the ""national bourgeoisie"" are even more interesting for us as theoretic debates:

&gt;Notsurprisingly, the leaders were sharply divided. The more experienced
members of the Central Committee, especially the former deputies
who had often found themselves on the same side as Mossadeq ... even
if the alliance was only tacit and indirect. They argued that the Tudeh
should help the National Front because the latter represented the
national bourgeoisie fighting British imperialism and working for a
national democratic revolution, and because the former could gradually
transform this national democratic revolution into a socialist
working-class revolution through petitions, meetings, and other forms
of mass action. **As an editorial in the party organ stated, the Tudeh
could work with Mossadeq since his National Front represented the
national bourgeoisie and the liberal aristocracy, genuinely opposed
the British oil company, advocated the redistribution of land, even if
too cautiously, and wanted to undermine the feudal class structure.**

&gt;The newer members of the Central Committee [what Abrahamian calls the ""hard-liners"" in this context], however, not only
opposed such an alliance but advocated direct confrontations with the
National Front. **They viewed Mossadeq not as the leader of the national
bourgeoisie fighting British imperialism, but as the puppet of
the comprador bourgeoisie attached to American imperialism**; not as
a great liberal constitutionalist but another Qavam who would inevitably
doublecross the Left; and not as a determined reformer but a
vacillating aristocrat who would eventually make his peace with the
forces of reaction, even with the shah.

&gt;In later years, the more moderate leaders criticized the hard-liners
for pursuing ultraleft policies. One recent historian of the student
movement has written that the partys youth organization during the
Mossadeq era held unauthorized demonstrations, published inflammatory
articles, manifested symptoms of romantic heroism, and considered itself rather than the working class as the vanguard of the
socialist revolution.

&gt;...

&gt;Kianouri, speaking at a seminar on the national bourgeoisie, declared, an incorrect assessment
of the role of the national bourgeoisie sometimes leads to
mistakes. . . . Such left-wing sectarian mistakes were made by our
Tudeh party between 1949 and 1953.

Ultimately though,

&gt;**The discussions of 1951-1953 had nonetheless been somewhat academic, since the final decision rested with Mossadeq, not with the
Tudeh. And Mossadeq opposed the formation of a united front, for
he realized that if he allied with the Tudeh he would antagonize the
United States.** If he antagonized the United States, he would lose
economic, political, and, most important of all, diplomatic assistance.
And if he lost these forms of assistance, he would face additional
financial difficulties, increased military instability, and further diplomatic
isolation in the conflict with Britain. Moreover, the other leaders
of the National Front were divided in their approach toward the
Tudeh. Whereas the Iran party and the more anticourt politicians,
such as Fatemi and Razavi, favored a tacit alliance, the Pan-Iranist
and Toilers parties, not to mention the clerical leaders, vehemently
opposed any form of cooperation. The day after the July uprising,
the organ of the Toilers party denounced the Tudeh as a foreign
conspiracy hatched jointly by Russia and Britain. Using more sophisticated
arguments, **Khalel Maleki warned that the Tudeh was making
impressive inroads into factories, schools, and government offices
because the authorities complacently believed their own propaganda
about the dissolved party and lacked the courage to restrict the
activities of international communism. He added that an alliance with
the Tudeh would prove disastrous for the National Front.**.",comment,/r/communism/comments/wsyhdi/mohammad_mossadegh_was_ousted_in_a_cia_backed/il3ly5t/,Communism

Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism**
&gt; 
&gt; A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society.
&gt; 
&gt; To this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class, organisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.
&gt; 
&gt; We may cite Proudhons Philosophie de la Misre as an example of this form.
&gt; 
&gt; The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.
&gt; 
&gt; A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.
&gt; 
&gt; Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.
&gt; 
&gt; Free trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism.
&gt; 
&gt; It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois  for the benefit of the working class.

It is an ideological creation of human beings. In this case it's the generic concept of the left that socialism is the extension of unions into a social order composed of freely associated labor. This is called syndicalism and has a long history, although leftists these days rarely call it that or are aware of what they are saying. Your goal should be to understand why the left believes certain things. Why do certain concepts become popular over others? If for no other reason, because the common sense on the left is not the same as the ""common man,"" your idea that 100 random people would agree with the DSA party line is simply wrong. For most people unions don't exist and communism is associated with the USSR and China, neither of which had a syndicalist line on unions. Syndicalism represents its own political and class interest which also must ve understood. More importantly, reality has objective laws and you cannot change them because they are inconvenient. If you have a flawed concept of global warming, the natural environment does not compromise with political reality or American common sense. Either you practice politics according to reality and make people's ideas conform to that reality or the Earth warms. Those are the two options. Communism is simply true, it does not depend whether people believe in it for this fact.

You're basically pretending that you're too stupid to think about why other people think about things because you don't understand your own thoughts.

It's frustrating to try to talk to someone trying to sabotage the conversation as you're having it.

To your other comments, you do not have to study Mao or Marx for their concepts to describe reality. Evolution by natural selection still applies to the world religious people live in who refuse to read Darwin.

&gt; What I'm trying to say is like, I'd think most people would associate the concept of the union with the workers struggle, and thus perhaps a little abstractly, socialism.

Who are ""most people"" and what do you mean by ""socialism""? Because to most people in the world, and not just labor aristocrats in the imperial core, communism (and by extension, socialism) is represented by the communist party. 

Historically, unions have been at best a fetter on class consciousness, because it reduces the political struggle for state-power to a mere economic struggle for better working conditions. The goal of communists has always been to elevate the proletariat beyond narrow economism.

Furthermore, unions have been used by both fascists and social democrats to minimize class consciousness and revolutionary action.

Not to mention labor aristocratic unions, like the AFL-CIO, which represents labor aristocrats who support and benefit from imperialism at the expense of oppressed nation proletarians.

&gt; So to have these unions which operate as layer upon layer of the protection of private property and ruling class interest, seems antithetical.

The point is that all unions maintain capitalism, because they work within its logic. Only the communist party can create revolution.

&gt; Easily digestible concepts are important in a time when people have shorter attention spans due to media that is becoming more snd more condensed. Again this is all in consideration of the common perception, people that haven't studied Marx and can't take the time our their life draining labor trading day to scientifically analyze stuff like this.

You take for granted that the labor aristocrats you engage with aren't interested in communism, because they are not exploited by imperialism. Proletarians have taken the time to study history and theory, because it directly relates to their suffering. At most, labor aristocrats develop a social fascist consciousness, which struggles for a better share of imperialism at the cost of the imperialized nations, which is what ""most people think socialism is"" it practice.

Idk if that makes sense. What I'm trying to say is like, I'd think most people would associate the concept of the union with the workers struggle, and thus perhaps a little abstractly, socialism. So to have these unions which operate as layer upon layer of the protection of private property and ruling class interest,  seems antithetical. I refrain from seeing the world through my most educated lenses, which are in reality,  quite blurry. When I'm considering the social relevance of an issue I just look at it through the most common lens and understanding.  Because at the end of the day, popular opinion usually shapes things. 
  And so I must recognize the value of concepts like ""ACAB"". It totally simplifies an idea, that police are ineffective and there's another way to live. That's it, that's what people come away with. And I believe that's a good thing because it opens up debates, it initiates conflict. It has to start somewhere.

Caste continues to play an intersecting role in the life of majority of Sri Lankans. Regional disparities and uneven development is the basic feature of the countrys developmental story. All these factors are bound to play out in the emerging phase of the Aragalaya. People need to learn to go beyond the prison house of their identities to empathise with all the oppressed sections. 

The concept of a prison house of nations implies that there are nations which are being held prisoner. This does not apply to a prison house of [one's] identity, which turns a social relationship into an individual one and severs the fundamental dialectic between the one who is a prisoner and the one holding others prisoner. It would be absurd to advocate the same politics for both as ""people"" or turn this struggle between forces into a struggle of wills within one mind.

The Sri Lankan left is strange because everyone can see that the right of secession of the oppressed Tamil nation is the key political question except the left in Sri Lanka, which ranges from social fascism (the kind the author displays, having presumably learned from the Indian left Hindutva) to full blown genocidal racism which simply sounds bizarre to anyone not immersed in it. Nor is this an abstract question of national oppression, the political legitimacy of the ruling class comes specifically out of the oppression of Tamils and its destruction of their political unity, warped and born with a core flaw by the social fascist left's hostility. And while the article poses the inability of the left to organize a revolutionary movement to seize power, this is a concrete question of who would be willing to seize power and who has no illusions about reformism or global capitalism to save the nation-state. I would imagine those who reject the very concept of the nation-state and fought a guerrilla war for decades are decent candidates. I found this discussion interesting

&gt;The Polish comrades simply repeated an obviously incorrect assertion (S. II, 1), saying that in questions of the annexation of foreign territories, forms of political democracy are pushed aside; sheer force is decisive.... Capital will never allow the people to decide the question of their state frontiers... As though capital could allow the people to select its civil servants, the servants of imperialism! Or as though weighty decisions on important democratic   questions, such as the establishment of a republic in place of a monarchy, or a militia in place of a regular army, were, in general, conceivable without sheer force. Subjectively, the Polish comrades want to make Marxism more profound but they are doing it altogether unsuccessfully. Objectively, their phrases about impracticability are opportunism, because their tacit assumption is: this is impracticable without a series of revolutions, in the same way as democracy as a whole, all its demands taken together. is impracticable under imperialism.

The question of neocolonialism doesn't really change anything except make the hypocrisy of the Polish communists disappear.

I ask this in a provocative way because the fetishism of unions is very strong on the left, even though (and perhaps because of) they are smaller and weaker than ever.

The usual answer, that unions are where the working class is and where it develops a political awareness, is both empirically wrong (a small fraction of the working class belongs to unions) and politically wrong

&gt;Is it true that, in general,[3] the economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into the political struggle? It is entirely untrue. Any and every manifestation of police tyranny and autocratic outrage, not only in connection with the economic struggle, is not one whit less widely applicable as a means of drawing in the masses. The rural superintendents and the flogging of peasants, the corruption of the officials and the police treatment of the common people in the cities, the fight against the famine-stricken and the suppression of the popular striving towards enlightenment and knowledge, the extortion of taxes and the persecution of the religious sects, the humiliating treatment of soldiers and the barrack methods in the treatment of the students and liberal intellectuals  do all these and a thousand other similar manifestations of tyranny, though not directly connected with the economic struggle, represent, in general, less widely applicable means and occasions for political agitation and for drawing the masses into the political struggle? The very opposite is true. Of the sum total of cases in which the workers suffer (either on their own account or on account of those closely connected with them) from tyranny, violence, and the lack of rights, undoubtedly only a small minority represent cases of police tyranny in the trade union struggle as such. Why then should we, beforehand, restrict the scope of political agitation by declaring only one of the means to be the most widely applicable, when Social-Democrats must have, in addition, other, generally speaking, no less widely applicable means?

This is even more true today where the concept of individual of identity and the possible forms of oppression is more developed than in Lenin's time. What of the more sophisticated argument that unions are the vanguard of socialist consciousness and therefore play an outstanding role beyond their numerical membership? Again, Lenin 

&gt;The economic struggle is the collective struggle of the workers against their employers for better terms in the sale of their labour-power, for better living and working conditions. This struggle is necessarily a trade union struggle, because working conditions differ greatly in different trades, and, consequently, the struggle to improve them can only be conducted on the basis of trade organisations (in the Western countries, through trade unions; in Russia, through temporary trade associations and through leaflets, etc.). Lending the economic struggle itself a political character means, therefore, striving to secure satisfaction of these trade demands, the improvement of working conditions in each separate trade by means of legislative and administrative measures (as Martynov puts it on the ensuing page of his article, p. 43). This is precisely what all workers trade unions do and always have done. Read the works of the soundly scientific (and soundly opportunist) Mr. and Mrs. Webb and you will see that the British trade unions long ago recognised, and have long been carrying out, the task of lending the economic struggle itself a political character; they have long been fighting for the right to strike, for the removal of all legal hindrances to the co-operative and trade union movements, for laws to protect women and children, for the improvement of labour conditions by means of health and factory legislation, etc.

&gt;Thus, the pompous phrase about lending the economic struggle itself a political character, which sounds so terrifically profound and revolutionary, serves as a screen to conceal what is in fact the traditional striving to degrade Social-Democratic politics to the level of trade union politics.

...

&gt;Revolutionary Social-Democracy has always included the struggle for reforms as part of its activities. But it utilises economic agitation for the purpose of presenting to the government, not only demands for all sorts of measures, but also (and primarily) the demand that it cease to be an autocratic government. Moreover, it considers it its duty to present this demand to the government on the basis, not of the economic struggle alone, but of all manifestations in general of public and political life. In a word, it subordinates the struggle for reforms, as the part to the whole, to the revolutionary struggle for freedom and for socialism.

...

&gt;Concessions are also possible and are made in the sphere of legislation concerning flogging, passports, land redemption payments, religious sects, the censorship, etc., etc. Economic concessions (or pseudo-concessions) are, of course, the cheapest and most advantageous from the governments point of view, because by these means it hopes to win the confidence of the working masses. For this very reason, we Social-Democrats must not under any circumstances or in any way whatever create grounds for the belief (or the misunderstanding) that we attach greater value to economic reforms, or that we regard them as being particularly important, etc.

Union reforms are one of many and a rather narrow field at that, again significantly more narrow than in Marx or Lenin's time when struggles over basic things like the 8 hour work day and banning child labor still provoked armed struggle between workers and the state. We can also add the internationalization of capital against the narrow nationalism of actually-existing unions, their long collaboration with imperialism, much more sophisticated political strategies of reformism and controlling the proletariat through a labor bureaucracy, the questions of race and gender and  settler-colonialism, and the changing nature of industry against the stagnant entrenchment of trads unions in certain industries. 

The presumption of your question is that unions are ""good"" and therefore you are surprised that some are not good. But when you liberate yourself from abstractions and establish every political line on a scientific analysis of concrete circumstances, you'll find not only that the dead-end opportunist syndicalism of the left comes into question but you are also free of ultraleftist, obnoxious concepts like ""ACAB."" That the particular reactionary nature of American police makes an abstraction possible about their essential reactionary nature in all circumstances is dangerous because it disarms you from understanding the real nature of unions in general and our ambiguous, indifferent attitude towards their particularly. This is more important than ever when new unions are forming in new kinds of industries and existing unions are seeking to absorb them and subordinate them to arrest their terminal decline and political bankruptcy.

Social Democracy and other better capitalism models were evolving and presented an false alternative. 

However, as with all capitalistic systems(they are actually not a system but just a collection and therefore the flaws that are never addressed), it cannot turn around and admit its mistake because you are putting the most powerful at risk. And it lacks the control that is required to navigate towards the right direction. So it kept spinning until it collapsed. It collapsed because of the natural vulture tendencies - if not it could be dragging on.

Stalin was trying to take the next step towards Communism, by democratizing the Soviets etc, but missed on the more nuanced approach required. Had he accepted a slower turn towards that, I believe he could have pulled it off. Then again, the pioneers need some luck as well when attempting a complex social transformation involving people. He instead got demonized for addressing the chaos caused by the enemies and revisionists.

The trouble with Capitalism is the lack of control to navigate towards a direction that will work for everyone. Instead, the people with access to the steering steers it in the direction that is advantageous to them. And it always ends up on the rocks sooner or later because the few people in the cabin cannot steer the ship on their own.

PCB - Partido Comunista Brasileiro (Brazilian Communist Party)

It's the most traditional, completing 100 years in 2022, and so it has a bunch of controversies about its support to Kruschev in URSS (which the party has made its self-critique). But, at all, is a quite good party, and I support!

It's presidential candidate for 2022 is Sofia Manzano

PCR - Partido Comunista Revolucionrio (Revolutionary Communist Party)

It's a non-institutionalized party, so it doesn't participate on the elections. It started as a fraction of PCdoB (which is a fraction of PCB) and has very solid and quite good principles. It has been created by Manoel Lisboa, a communist revolutionary killed by the dictatorship in Brazil

PSTU - Partido Socialista dos Trabalhadores Unificado (Unified Socialist Party of the Workers)

it started as a fraction of PT (Partido dos Trabalhadores/Worker's Party) amd  it's trotskyist, so it's quite trashy.

It's presidential candidate for 2022 is Vera Lcia

PCO - Partido da Causa Operria (Operariate Cause Party)

it started just like PSTU, but PCO is worse because it's totally a 5th collumn of communist movement in brazil. It has actually tolerated a fascist in the party

UP - Unidade Popular (Popular Unity)

It's the youngest party in brazil and an alternative to PCB. It has positions strongly against the chinese socialism and adopts a quite ortodox democratic centralism

It's presidential candidate for 2022 is Leonardo Pricles

Marxism was off the table so they had to construct a 'anti-liberal' philosophy that covers everyone from Geunon, Spengler, Levi-Strauss and even the new left. 

It only seems to make sense since we live in an era where global liberalism is completely hegemonic so any contradictions or problems have to be displaced onto the bad enemy of 'Russia' and never due to the imperialist system itself. That what makes me skeptical of any western scholar that points to Dugin and repeat the same ""soviet subversion"" model that the fascist Yuri Bezmenov said (the fascism of the cold war is now liberalism in our current era). Putin does not need to be enlightened by Dugin for his actions in Ukraine, he is just reacting to the developments of the world system including low rates of profit, the race to the bottom in the globalized value chain, using his only monopoly-capitalist institution of the military to make Russian prices competitive and the aggression from NATO to completely encircle it. 

A use of Marxism is to deconstruct and demystify the alleged reasons why representatives of a class do their actions while concealing the real basis that is market exchange and imperialist expansion, not even to mention how class struggle can change the entire situation and provides a ceiling of what actions the bourgeoise can be done in the face of the threat of revolution.

And this is reflected in the article, Brazil is only mentioned three times as a whole, and none of them seem relevant: one is the date of the country's presidential election, the 1964 coup, and the last one noting the absence of Bolivarianism, which Brazil actually was never a part of, and [Lula openly jested this political stance](https://pcb.org.br/portal2/1778).

Further evidence is that while we saw in the rest of the continent constant popular pressure against imperialist coups, and even some trials and prisons like Jeanine Aez in Bolivia, this never happened in Brazil. Political pressure to Lula's prison only created the Lula Livre Camp in front of where he was arrested and a pathetic line of 'Lula Livre' merchandise from petty-bourgeois entrepreneurs. There was barely any violent reaction since 2016 until now, a far cry from our Latin brothers. If anything, Lula was brought out of jail by the same Judicial system that imprisoned him, nullyfing all of Moro's sentences after the bourgeoisie realized that the fascist Bolsonaro project brought more harm than good to their class interest. Otherwise, why Ablio Diniz, one of the country's largest capitalists, openly supports the Workers' Party against Bolsonaro? Why the main capitalist associations like FEBRABAN, FIESP and many others instantly dismiss Bolsonaro's fascist bravado, with his last line of support being the country's lumpenproletariat?

It's sometimes somewhat sad to see Brazilian communists and first world communists tailing third world social-democratic governments, and this sub's no exception. Six years have passed since Dilma's fall, and the more objectively we look at the past, the Workers' Party's sole achievement can be summed up as 'real wage gains', while all other developments to class consciousness have disappeared, and this plagues our communist organizations and parties, having to constantly deal with the barrage of arguments of 'material gains to the working class' and 'supporting elections' just to put a lesser evil in the Executive, somewhat mimicking First World Democratic Party supporting liberals, no wonder PCB, PSTU, PCO and PCR/UP have all capitulated to this.",comment,/r/communism/comments/wmsxxc/latin_americas_fourth_left_wave_since_the_cuban/ik4m6l2/,Communism

I cannot draw any conclusion on my fellow neighbors' politics and social dynamics. That being said, Lula's run for the Executive office this time will be different.

Following the 2016' coupe d'tat that ousted Dilma from power, the Workers' Party under the leadership of Lula aimed to promote a renegotiation of terms with the center right:

1) During his period in a cell inside the Federal Police office in Curitiba, Lula rallied the more radical (yet, not that radical) leftist movements around him. He defended the idea of a united front against the ""elites"", hinting a possible alliance with the socialist leader of PSOL, Guilherme Boulos (a well known head of the Homeless Workers' Movement of So Paulo). Other parties and groups supported that idea.

2) Yet, a few days after leaving imprisonment, Lula broke the deal and gathered with some leaderships of the right and center-right.

3) His current VP candidate is So Paulo's former Governor, Geraldo Alckmin. Alckmin was the head of the So Paulo Caucus of the center-right's party PSDB. PSDB was the first party to file an impeachment lawsuit against Dilma, following the 2014's defeat of its running candidate, the cocaine-induced, wife-beating and son of former military-appointed governor of Minas Gerais state, Acio Neves. Before that, Alckmin was known for his successive neoliberal, aggressive and repressive policies against black communities in the State of So Paulo. He successfully destroyed the State Public System of Education, amped-up the militarization of the already Military Police (Gendarmerie) of the State. In his rsum you can find the organization of a billionaire bribery scheme with the support of German company Siemens on the approval of purchases of subway trains for the city of So Paulo. Additionally, he is currently under scrutiny by the OAS (The Organization of American States) court of human rights for the violence of his policy on policing of black communities and repression of social movements. On top of that, you can add another lawsuit for omitting and promoting torture practices within such police.

4) Lula is repressing dissent within its party: many ""more radical"" or ""historical leaderships"" within the Workers' Party have been shut down by the majority aligned with Lula. The reason, many observers believe, has to do with the Workers' Party most right-wing agenda since its foundation in the 1980s. Lula is signalling to the financial market a new wave of ""socially negotiated"" neoliberalism. However, this time around, he has to deal with a never-before seen armed population (with Bolsonaro suspending the ban on assault rifles).

5) The Military have purchased millions of dollars in espionage equipment and infrastructure to monitor the civil populations' cellphone and data traffic. They questioned our electronic voting system, accused several social movements of terrorism, and have since Bolsonaro's appointment, praised the military rule and colonial past of Brazil (Bolsonaro's VP and Army General Mouro twitted a statement calling Portuguese settler colonialists ""entrepreneurs"").

6) During his time in office, Lula actively defunded and acted against Labor Unions and large social movements like the Landless Workers' Movements. He is eager to bring Chinese investments to Brazil, even though said investments has been the cause of many Original Peoples' forced removal from their lands to give space for mining and plantations.

I could go on and on...

To be honest, just thinking about this election makes me depressed. You can add to all the abovementioned points the demographic expansion of extremist evangelism, growing influence of paramilitary militias formed by ex-police and army officers, and the current famine that the most marginalized groups are going through (20 million people). With or without Lula, we will have a new form of Neoliberal Coup against the ""working class"". How can we achieve class-consciusness when living as jobless non-unionized workers under the rule of ""uberized"" economy (gig economy)?.",comment,/r/communism/comments/wmsxxc/latin_americas_fourth_left_wave_since_the_cuban/ik297eq/,Communism

His key work on fascism is [The Fascist Offensive &amp; Unity of the Working Class](https://foreignlanguages.press/foundations/the-fascist-offensive-unity-of-the-working-class-george-dimitrov/). That's the one you gonna want to read. Luckily FLP just put out a new edition, and one with an added later speech that stresses the creative application and concrete investigation of this theory by those wanting to put it into action.

In addition to that I would recommend reading the earlier ComIntern decisions on fascism, which are the basis for Dimitrov's further development. [Gramsci's early articles on the matter](https://www.marxists.org/archive/gramsci/spw2-contents.htm) are interesting for a couple of reasons: 1) you get an excellent example of the Marxist method in action; 2) you see him apply and develop the ComIntern decisions; 3) you see how he comes to learn that the fascist mass base is increasingly dependent on the monopoly bourgeoisie. [Clara Zetkin's texts on fascism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/index.htm) are also important and well worth the read (brief too). Like Dimitrov and Gramsci she also worked in the ComIntern. So this will give some historical context to Dimitrov's book.",comment,/r/communism/comments/wkhb4k/the_shock_of_recognition_by_j_sakai_is_the_single/ijycxtl/,Communism

What is especially interesting of course is how, despite avowals to supporting Palestinian resistance, few communists have consulted the position of Palestinian resistance forces and developments along those lines. The martyrs Nizar Banat, Basil Al-Araj, and the organized movements of PFLP, PIJ have been firm on supporting Syria and its army.

As you carefully outlined, fascism is almost better understood as a methodology than an ideology - a form of political judo whereby you take the working class anger and resentment that might be aimed at capitalism and skilfully redirect it against a suitable sacrificial scapegoat (the Jews, immigrants, communists, foreigners et. al.). I believe this is why fascism can differ so greatly across regimes and be so slippery to define. It takes whatever form is required to draw attention away from the fundamental injustice inherent in the economic system.

Case in point, Sakai makes the fatal error, when describing modern US fascism as ""anti-imperialist"", of taking fascists at their word. Modern fascism is ""anti-imperialist"" only to the extent that it's proponents have recognized that the appetite of the reactionary working classes for overseas adventurism has waned after the events of the last two decades. This is an opportunistic rather than a deeply-held ideological belief. Will this stance hold true in a couple of decades after memories of Iraq and Afghanistan have faded and the American empire continues to decline in the face of Chinese ascendency?

The bulk of the market is in chips for which China already has the technology or can play catch up with its investments in research and in building the entire supply chain, including chip fabrication and even DUV machines.

Without these profits, U.S. companies will not be able to finance their future development.

I thought this part was interesting, especially in that for all the talk of technological superiority the economic incentive for these more advanced chips is lacking. That the US wants to restrict China in its growth while simultaneously benefitting from it (where Chinas maturing markets sustain failing profits at home).

Sakai doesn't mention him by name but criticizes his theory throughout his text, you have to be familiar with Dimitrov's theory and its popular image (which is almost always a parody condensed to a single sentence and abstracted from the great theoretical and historical context) to see it.

Marx made an important distinction in the conception of revolution: there's the **political revolution**, which can be as little as a change in power or say mode of government. Under this conception you can say that fascism is revolutionary as it aims to supplant bourgeois democracy with a dictatorial state. But that's the superficial form of revolution. The second conception is that of the **social revolution**, which comprises an entire historical period where the mode of production and the superstructure, that is the entire social formation, undergoes a qualitative change. The social revolution includes as one of its steps the political revolution but it is only one of its moments. The political revolution does not necessarily lead to a social revolution, it can just as well be a change of rule within the bourgeoisie (like the usual coups, like the fascist ""revolution"").

When we Marxists talk about revolution in most cases we mean social revolution, and from what I recall that's how Sakai uses it, too. Since he talks about the disgust the fascist have of bourgeois decadence and whatever.

I want to stress that I'm not one of the people who generally throw Sakai into the trash. I think he has important things to say, very important things in the case of settler colonialism.

Who We Are
We recognize the reputation of violence and chaos that precedes the term anarchy. With this reputation, we have taken special care to set forth our objections to it. We believe we live in a world of daily violence. You may not see it, but the world we all exist in is set atop a monopoly of it, and that monopoly is in the possession of the state. This violence is a holistic, existential one that drains your spirit and exhausts your body. It also exists systemically, as we see in the carceral system (slavery, disenfranchisement, WE LOCK HUMANS IN CAGES), our corrupt sham of a democracy (Supreme Court isnt elected, neoliberalism, widespread corruption), and the multiple genocides we have committed and supported and continue to profit from. Yet the most pervasive atrocities slip beneath the view of the privileged, allowing them to ignore the cries of the downtrodden.
Someone who is hungry and poor must beg for food or steal; for both, they will likely be arrested or harassed by the police. All they needs is food, but we have placed food behind a monetary barrier. How cruel and unusual! Do you wait and die hungry and forgotten, like the people punishing your hunger think you should? Or do you risk public humiliation, police and carceral violence, and institutional gaslighting that you should have starved rather than disrespect property? Our economic system, protected and served by our domestic military force, fights for the right of food to be bought and sold, and throws the stuff (and people) they cannot sell in the garbage.
This, to us, is evidence that the system doesnt serve our interests, the most important of these being the sustenance of human life. This violence impacts specific cultural minorities more than others, and as queer people we want to fight for better living conditions, better working conditions, and better standards of education for our community. We want to create networks of mutual aid and power from the ground up because we have seen that the state wants nothing more than to take our power away.
Do these principles and goals sound violent to you? Does the idea of empowering your community against the institutions holding us from truly free association with those around us sound like the chaotic image that is painted? It may sound idealistic and utopian, but we do not simply hope for the revolution. We do not believe we hold ideological superiority to anyone, even other anarchists. We are people in need who have decided to work towards supporting our queer siblings.
And so, how can you get involved? We are looking for queer people of all backgrounds to join. If we are being perfectly honest, we would love a more diverse group of voices to help represent our pluralist attitude towards our role in the community. We want to start a mutual aid fund, where people contribute money that goes towards getting material goods to people in need. This includes food, gender-affirming clothing (including binders), menstrual products, and a wide-assortment of other necessities. We would love to host queer barbeques or potlucks to create a safe space for people to be themselves and meet new queer people. If we have enough people willing to collaborate, we would love to agitate for unions in both campus and surrounding area workplaces, as well as tenant unions for student housing. We also believe in police abolition, and the omnipresent BG Police Department is something we have our eyes set on farther in the future.
Anarchists have always placed a large significance in art, and so we also want to create the infrastructure to connect and platform musicians, artists, storytellers, poets, playwrights, filmmakers, and various other creatives to make expressive and subversive art. We believe that this area is a hotbed for an artistic explosion, and we would love to be the catalyst to that.
We have had enough of our lives being controlled by our place in society. We did not ask to be queer. We have followed ancient advice: I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE. We have melded the human and divine within us and have emerged as something this society could never imagine. We have needs beyond the scope of this culture, and it has decided to imprison, beat, humiliate, lie about, and murder us. This was by design. We would much rather rely on our friends and family to feed us than a politician. If you agree, help us take our power back.
 
Why Us?
We believe that if we do not step up now, there is no guarantee another will step up. We also think our group holds true to values of voluntary association and non-coercion. We believe anarchy is not an ideology to learn, but a set of tactics and behaviors to employ. This means that we dont exclude anarchists-of-faith. We also do not believe anarchy is some far-off future, but something we can participate in today. We make active efforts to discuss a wide array of topics and center a diverse pool of voices. Our queer specialty is still something we strive to make inclusive. We believe that by maintaining our horizontal structure, we remain formless and cannot raise or lower any voice unless explicitly agreed to by everyone. Hierarchy, especially of ideology and thought, is how we lose ourselves.
We also have high ambitions. If other groups were to step forward and create these networks alongside us, we would love to see more people take back power in this community. However, since we are the only group of young anarchists representing our interests right now, we want to do as much as we can as well as we can. This requires a lot of members who are full of the spirit of anarchy and have time to contribute their skills or materials. You do not necessarily have to come to every book club meeting or help organize every event (in fact, we dont want ANY one person organizing every event). Your contribution can be donating to our org fund that will help us afford materials, asking about our org publication Community Trash, or interacting with some of the work we recommend in our further reading section. We also have a book club every Sunday from 9:30 am-11:00am where we discuss anarchist literature (or other creative works) through an anarchist lens.

Here is the comment: Proudhon didn't think the working class should organize autonomously, he was against strikes.

Wow what a great anarchist.

What the hell is he talking about?

I did find some quotes another user brought up. 

""Association  Determine my line of conduct and my plan in advance: utilizing men and sacrificing them as soon as they become an obstacle and dont work anymore, or as soon as they want to drag the Society along a false road. No politics of liberalism... "" [1:270]

""Association  After the first criticisms, carry out the repression of the publications and utopias of the Cabetists, Fourierists and of L'Unit. (...)

Place a prohibition on meetings, banquets, private gatherings, lectures, propaganda, subscriptions, magazines, newspapers and pamphlets."" [1:275]

""No compromise with parties: Communists, Fourierists, etc, annihilate around us, or assimilate."" [1:270]

""Eliminate men of every opinion, who by manifestations of opinion have pronounced their own downfall. (...)

No hatred! No, no hatred. Eliminate as a matter of principle."" [1:283]

""... if I had to sacrifice the human race, I would sacrifice it to what seems the truth to me, and I would take pride in thinking, while making this sacrifice, that I represent humanity by myself alone, and that though losing a million millions of men, nothing has been lost."" [1:185]

""The representative of the people  that is Me. For I, I alone, am right."" [2:307)

Im not super versed in Proudhon. But I know enough to know he was a socialist who advocated for collective managed worker cooperatives. And Bakunin and Kropotkin both cited Proudhon as a major influence. Were they trying to take over the world too? I highly doubt it.

So bc of having toxic friend groups when leaving HS, and being kicked out for calling out abusive behavior with certain members of friend groups (who have since been kicked out themselves for being toxic AF) I no longer really have friends besides my newer conservative (never-Trump, weirdly liberal Republican) roommate. I don't have family, bc half of my family is fascist and directly covers up for my pedo dad, and the other half is literally trying to put me in jail for questioning if I want to live or not, ik, beautiful life I was forced to have.

I'm the only anarchist I know in the real world, I think I've always been an anarchist, but mainly started reading into theory starting with Proudhon, then Kropotkin, then Stirner, along with a variety of authors on the anarchist library starting in 2019. I've done some action on my own in another state, mainly bc I couldn't find any like-minded people near me unless they're Stalinists, Maoists or AnCaps (which are nowhere near anarchism), and bc being in a neighborhood filled with unhoused people gives a lot of opportunities to help others. Rn I'm in a small town 30 mins away from the twin cities, there's no unhoused people in my neighborhood or anyone doing volunteering stuff unless it's a right wing church doing bake sales.

These days I'm mainly at work, being forced to run the rat race like everyone else until I can maybe afford a decent van to build out and live out of, and while there's a lot of people at my workplace, most of them don't want a friend to hang out with afterwards, they just want a coworker to BS with on the job before going to their loved ones, fair enough, and I feel I'm the only person that's actually left of center in my building. Whenever I'm not at work (as of the last few months that is), I've been either playing video games or trying to learn more shit or getting stuck in YT videos which hasn't been helping but I don't know what else to do, especially with everything being so fucking expensive. I've tried dating apps, but I don't take pictures of myself often, nor do I remember to do so when I'm out of the house, and shitty indoor selfies on a dating app do no favors, and also people are generally there to strictly date, so friend making isn't a thing there.

I've tried going to some local bars just to even find people in my age range, but hardly any millennials or younger go to the bar, it's stuffed with old white Republicans. I've been debating moving directly into the city again once I have the money just to give me more opportunities of things to do, but that still doesn't solve the issue I have of trying to make friends, and bc of all of this I feel I'm becoming more anti social which isn't gaining me any favors.

How does everyone else manage with a lack of friends? Have you been able to find your clique or do you compromise by hanging out with Tankies/AnCaps? If you're in or near the twin cities or have resources or groups or mutual aid circles that have people in their 20s, I'm almost begging for a DM.

the internet is so exhausting. You know you are about to broach a sensitive subject, you know the position you are about to take could cause people to have immediate and polarized reactions, in anticipation of this, you are very careful to state your case so clearly that it could not possibly be misunderstood, and yet you will be anyway.

You: ""I actually agree with him. Youre acting like there is a center between evil and not evil."" ""you're not arguing in good faith""

Me: ""I do think anarchism is more morally correct than nationalism.""

""But I acknowledge their (Anarchists') moral foundation is growing from a morally good place and nationalism from an evil one.""

""I am not saying the two are equivalent. I am trying to say both are undesirable, although certainly not equal, hard to even rank against one another frankly cause they arent even the same kind of undesirable.""

'I think that white nationalism grows from purely evil soil, ethically, morally. I do not think anarchism is a moral disaster. I dont agree with it, personally, but I am able to recognize that it grows from more moral soil.""

Are you sure you're not reading in bad faith? I think Racial Nationalism (frankly any form of identitarian nationalism) an an organized and purposeful malice, a disaster of evil intent. I think Anarchy is, or rather would be since it's never really been ""in charge"" in any substantial way, a disaster of good intentions seeking impossible outcomes.

I am not attempting to drawn any moral equivalence between them. When I referenced in my first post ""which is a greater evil"" I was very careful to say to which is more ""practically"" good or evil, and I mean that in a practical material sense, as in which agenda being pursued would reap a greater harm upon the people of the world, and that is very hard to say. Which is why in my followup reply to you I used the analogy:

Would I rather be shot by someone who hates me or accidentally stabbed by someone who thinks they are helping me? I want neither. Thank you very much.

I am drawing a clear difference in intent, and type of harm, and hell even degree of harm in this analogy, but still concluding that both are undesirable and if I am able to have my say in the matter, I don't want either.

And for the record, while I haven't read every anarchist work out there, I have read The Conquest of Bread, which is considered by many to be one of, if not the, foundational political text for modern anarchism. In addition to just general research.

Which book exactly would you recommend I must have read to ""know what I am talking about?"" Do tell. What book lays out of image of an anarchist world in which no radical or revolutionary or extreme change or actions are necessary. The only such anarchists I've ever encountered are those who don't propose that anarchism should be applied to society broadly as some form of cultural revolution, but jus that they and their small commune should be allowed to live that way in their own space if they wish, but anarchism that only seeks to like in squalor in the woods of Montana somewhere with a few dozen people is not the kind of anarchism I'm talking about.

Regardless of your personal experiences, The narrative you are trying to forward is the centrist ""both of these are bad"" bullshit when one is an ideology that sets a clear racial hierarchy and the other is opposed to that.

Your last paragraph, In which you make claims that anarchists never do anything, or if they did it would be just as bad is nonsense as well. Many work in ""direct action"" where they engage in counter protests, organize for unions, provide emergency support to local minority groups.  
Right now in this post Row V Wade environment we are offering discreet transportation for women in need of health care.

You might think that you are opposed to their ideology, but the perspective you present is strikingly similar in that your assumption is that western society is fair and Just.

IT's not and Anarchists want to change that.

I really don't know how to reply to this, cause it seems like all nuance is just getting blasted out by the heat of your ideological furnace. I feel like I've been so incredibly clear that I've done my part in this conversation. You need to read to understand and not merely read to reply.

I didn't say anarchists don't do anything, I didn't say opposing racial hierarchies is bad, I didn't say western society is fair and just, I don't think at any point in this conversation I even brushed up against the topic of western moral character broadly.

It's like you're just highlighting a few keywords from my replies and building a character in your mind that isn't me and responding to things this hypothetical character might think or say which I did not.

Yeah. I said they have never run a major world country with populations of hundreds of millions for generations. Which is, in fact, true.

And you accused me of saying they dont do anything, which isnt true and also isnt what I said.

How can you directly quote me not saying the thing and still try to say Im saying the thing.

Yes you made a red herring argument.

Anarchists don't believe in hierarchy, An country of anarchists is an oxymoron.

I was just letting that pass, since it spoke for itself.

The meat of the quote I was actually referring to is here: ""

""We have no idea what harms they may or may not do in pursuit of what they think of as the good city""

I originally clipped the entire statements to ensure it was not taken out of context.

Then I listed things that anarchists do as a rebuttal to your claim of ""we have no idea what they may or may not do""

So do you have an idea of what they might or might not do, or are you going to continue to pretend that I don't understand what you are trying to say?

A country of anarchist is an oxymoron I dont think you are correct and dont think most anarchist writer or thinkers would agree with you. A nation made up of an institutional hierarchy, yes, a nation that is an alliance of syndicates or communes or communities or peoples who organize for mutual benefit under a shared banner, I think that kind of nation is precisely what many anarchists agitate for.

But hey, if your particular brand of anarchism rejects all notions of a national or regional organization or identity, then cool, Im not gonna lecture you on your own personal beliefs.

But the point of my comment was not that anarchist have never controlled an large scale institutional hierarchy, of course they havent, I wouldnt imply they would or should have. Thats not what I was getting at at all.

Once again you assume Im a dummy who doesnt know what you know. Stoppit. Assume I know literally everything you know, at least as relates to this subject, assume we are intellectual and information equals, and yet I still disagree with you. Stop assuming the least charitable and most ignorant possible intent behind everything I say.

So, to re-state my point in a way so clear that you cant uncharitably interpret it into cartoonish silliness to give yourself something easier to argue against:

Anarchist principles have never been the guiding communal philosophy over a large swathe of geographically contiguous people on a global stage across multiple generations. Therefore, we have no idea how anarchists would conduct themselves, what booms or busts, gifts or terrors, they might get up to in an attempt to both establish and maintain their ideals in a broad setting as applied to massive populations and diverse communities which must interact and network with each other, and with outside nationals of a different structure, in some kind of way as part of a broader society.

Or, in much simpler terms which I thought were clear in the first place: There has never been a long standing nation of anarchists. So we cant say what theyd do.

And to say weve never committed atrocities when youve never had the power to commit any, is no form of point for your side. A perfect driving record for someone who has never driven is meaningless. (Atrocities of the scale and type the systems you wish to supplant have. Obviously individual anarchists and a handful of radical anarchist groups have done really nasty shit. But Im not never really counting that)

Now you went on to point out a whole host of smaller scale things anarchists do. Protest and agitate for just causes, feed hungry people, create support networks for abortion access and so on so forth.

Well so what? Capitalists do that too. Hell I do that stuff. So anarchists can advocate and agitate for good causes just like the rest of us. Good. Thats the bare minimum. That says absolutely fuck all about how those same people and those same ideas would function when applied broadly in a large international scale. Surely you recognize capitalists doing that good stuff is no indication that their broad scale implementations would be good. Same with anarchism.

And if you dont care about the large international scale, and are only interested in the street level robin hood type anarchism. Then cool, I release you from all criticism. Anarchism that doesnt seek broad large scale radical societal change isnt the kind Im criticizing. Based on, ya know, the fact that I specifically called out extreme and radical and revolutionary change many many times already in this conversation.

&gt;"" a nation that is an alliance of syndicates or communes or communities or peoples who organize for mutual benefit under a shared banner, I think that kind of nation is precisely what many anarchists agitate for.""

I don't think so, the more infrastructure you create, the less control the individual has in their own actions. I would argue that creating another level of hierarchy that exists to control the subordinate levels would result in people being less free, not more free.

""Anarchist principles have never been the guiding communal philosophy over a large swathe of geographically contiguous people on a global stage across multiple generations.  
Allow me to introduce you to Hunter gatherer groups that lived in relative equity for hundreds of thousands of years prior to the development of the state.

""Once again you assume Im a dummy who doesnt know what you know. Stoppit. Assume I know literally everything you know, at least as relates to this subject, assume we are intellectual and information equals""

That's difficult to do when everything I learned in university runs contrary to your claims.  
For example I couldn't just assume that you already knew about H-G groups. Otherwise you would have included them in your analysis of what you think is or isn't possible.

1- anarchist and anarcho-communist traditions dont call for large scale organized alliances or collaborative networks.

I mean, if YOUR personal anarchism doesnt, then cool. Like I said, Im not gonna tell you that you are wrong about your own beliefs. But I have read the famous (or infamous depending on who you ask ) Conquest of Bread, which is pretty well regarded as a key anarchist text, and it certainly lays out in great detail the necessity of maintaining advanced networks and relationships between industrial syndicates and communities organized nationally or at least regionally towards common interests and for shared protection. And Ive had a great many quite lengthy discussion with many anarchists about the need to organize industries and means of production and needs of consumption across a national scale as part of the workers revolution, with many even proposing that the high level national or international organizing for their hypothetical anarchist world would be conduction by regional syndicate congresses. And of course unless you somehow with the snap of a finger convert the whole globe to anarchism all at one youll need some organizing body to conduct diplomacy and trade with other nations that are still capitalist or whatever. Defend your borders. Work out imports of materials your geographic region doesnt have, etc etc

BUT, Again, If your version of anarchism doesnt seek to supplant existing social structures at a state or national or international level, well then I dont really care. Whatever. Thats not what Im talking about.

2- You are dead ass wrong to characterize Hunter gatherer societies as hierarchy-less societies with no obligatory participation or coercion through violence.

But even if you were right, which you arent, but even if you were, once again you try and reframe my argument in the most silly and reductionist way to make it easier to argue against. Lets assume when I said anarchists have never I meant in recorded history and wasnt counting pre recorded history. If we are talking about The Conquest of Bread here, how about we start sometime after bread was invented. If we are talking about economies and rights and state violence, maybe start sometimes after the advent of those things? Maybe the Bronze Age at least?

Give me a break man, its getting pretty exhausting chasing you off into ridiculous cartoonish extremes. I dont think you are accustomed to dwelling thoughtfully on an argument before replying. Really, genuinely, give it a try. Stop assuming you know things I dont and trying to find a rhetorical gotcha. Assume I know everything you do, or try this, and this might sting a little, but try assuming I am actually smarter than you and actually know things you dont, and respond carefully and thoughtfully as if maybe the other person might have insight you dont.

Comment read as so: ""I do think it is in out best interests not to antagonize the more 'soft' left wing, like democratic socialists.

And most people who are 'soft' left are genuinly nice and empathatic people who want people to be happier and more equal, though probably just lack the knowledge of the theory of the further left or just can't be arsed with it. Many people from the 'soft' left wing will  support anarchist causes, even if they are not too familiar with us as a whole.

When it comes to USSR  (&amp; other '''commie countries''') sympathizers however, they should be looked down upon. At best they just have an unrealistic view on what the USSR was.

My ideas, art, and philosophy do stand in opposition to the state structure among other structures that are destructive. Through learning and developing my own ideas (ideas subject to cognitive bias and faulty assumptions like anyone else) I have come to the conclusion that so called radical measures have to be taken in order to ameliorate society. The problem is its not radical, not *really*. Ideas like housing and food access for all, demilitarization, the implementation of gift economies and right to repair policy and manufacturing. To me, these ideas arent radical anymore. Maybe at one point they were, but not anymore. I think labeling yourself as radical, or your ideas, tends to *make* them radical (s/o SOC 202). 
All of this to say, given the praxis we can implement like now, that fixing the language around these ideas and reflecting on why you are anarchist anarchist-adjacent is an easy thing you can do.

*(This will be crossposted to both r/@ and the meta sub)*

## The Main Part:

So Reddit's AEO ~~bot~~ err...team...has recently undergone some changes, which seem to have led to them being more aggressive with admin removals of content. We used to see maybe one a month or so - now there have been *7 in the past week, alone.*

As you're probably aware, mods of *any* sub *have to* enforce the site-wide rules, whether we agree with them or not. 

One that has seemingly been getting renewed attention from AEO is [the rule \(and subsequent elaboration\) about violent content](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151-Do-not-post-violent-content):

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; *Rule 1: Remember the human.  Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence.*
&gt; 
&gt; Do not post content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual (including oneself) or a group of people; likewise, do not post content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. We understand there are sometimes reasons to post violent content (e.g., educational, newsworthy, artistic, satire, documentary, etc.) so if youre going to post something violent in nature that does not violate these terms, ensure you provide context to the viewer so the reason for posting is clear.
&gt; 
&gt; If your content is borderline, please use a NSFW tag. Even mild violence can be difficult for someone to explain to others if they open it unexpectedly.
&gt; 
&gt; Some examples of violent content that would violate the Rule:
&gt; 
&gt; * Post or comment with a credible threat of violence against an individual or group of people.
&gt; * Post containing mass killer manifestos or imagery of their violence.
&gt; * Terrorist content, including propaganda.
&gt; * Post containing imagery or text that incites, glorifies, or encourages self-harm or suicide.
&gt; * Post that requests, or gives instructions on, ways to self-harm or commit suicide.
&gt; * Graphic violence, image, or video without appropriate context.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that health misinformation, namely falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader, also violates the Rule. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are (few) positives and (many) negatives in their newfound zeal:

**Pro:**

Things like the R-slur are being removed from Reddit as a violation of site-wide rule #1 (if reported). Our AutoModerator^^[1] already has protections in place for that, so it never gets to the community. However, even if something is actioned by the moderators and/or AutoModerator, AEO will still often come in after the fact, and put one the new `[Removed by Reddit]` tags on it (which most people will never see, because again, we've already taken it down)....

[1] - *More on the AutoModerator in the other housecleaning stuff*

**Cons:**

* They are removing some ***very*** tame stuff including posts that are very clearly calls to self-defense and other seemingly innocuous things (like [this response](https://i.postimg.cc/L6f8DgkP/Screenshot-2022-08-19-at-13-46-01-9-Anarchism-Beneath-the-pavement-the-beach.png) to a post asking how to deal with abusers and their enablers)
* Certain reports, regardless of what action is taken by moderators, are also copied to the admins - this doesn't only include the [first page](https://i.postimg.cc/tJstwNRp/Screenshot-2022-08-19-at-13-57-53-newest-submissions-reddit-com.png) of site-wide report issues, but as I was recently told by an admin:

  &gt; subreddit report reasons containing certain keywords related to site-wide rules are sometimes reviewed by the safety team as well, but I am not 100% sure what the exact criteria is.

While we haven't received any direct notices or warnings from admins, two things are known:

1. Reddit doesn't particularly love r/@. They're not specifically ""after us"" (as far as we know, anyway), but given the subject matter of the sub, we're certainly not going to receive anything that could be mistaken for favorable treatment or a lot of extra chances.
2. Subreddits that consistently fail to moderate content that violates the site-wide rules are punished - depending on the size/activity of the subreddit, this can range from ""polite warnings"" to quarantines (which are almost impossible to recover from) to outright bans.

##### The ""terrorist"" part

Just being an anarchist is enough for one to be classified by some governments as a ""terrorist"" - as of writing, Reddit doesn't seem to agree with that classification....yet. If/when they change that position, it will be game over for the sub, and there won't really be anything any of us can do about it. It would be wise to consider backup platforms (like [Raddle](https://raddle.me)) before that happens.

#### Get to the point...

Yeah, sorry....what this means is that we, as mods, have to be less lenient than we normally would be in terms of removing content if we want to protect the sub from the consequences above. Given that we quite often have bad actors come into the sub and report things that the *actual community* would know as innocuous, if we reasonably believe that Reddit will see it otherwise, we're gonna have to remove it.

We've reached out to one user who recently had their artwork removed by AEO under this rule, despite the fact that there is explicitly an exemption for artwork carved out in the rule. However, until we hear back from them about whether they intend to appeal and the results of that appeal, we may be forced to even take down some content that *should* be okay by the Rules As Written.

Obviously, if we hear good news back, we'll be able to use that as armor with the admins moving forward.

## Mod Elections

It's almost that time again - r/Anarchism mod elections are coming up shortly (in about a week or so). Now is a good time to start thinking about who you might want to nominate or if you'd like to nominate yourself (yes, that's allowed). **The Mod elections are held [in the Meta sub](https://reddit.com/r/metanarchism), so if you qualify^^[2] and you're not already a member, consider joining so you can have a say!**

[2] - *In short: Must be an anarchist with at least a 3 month history (and 10+ comments worth) of positive, constructive (read: positive karma, not trolling/shitposting) participation in r/Anarchism*

## Housecleaning

#### Auto Mod

I've recently been working on fixing some of the AutoModerator regex in our slur detection rules. There were instances where a base slur would be caught, but the plural form wouldn't be, etc. I also added some intentional misspellings and common evasion stuff (using numbers in place of letters) people may use to get around it.

For the ableist slurs that get removed, I've also added a link to [this Autistic Hoya article](https://www.autistichoya.com/2014/02/violence-linguistic-ableism.html) along with their [glossary of ableist phrases](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html) to the AutoModerator response, which will provide more clarity for why the sub removes that content and *hopefully* cut down on some of the modmail we receive asking why things like ""st/pid"" are removed and berating us, lol

#### For other mods

For the mods that use the r/Toolbox add-on, I made some macros to save us some time with some common removal responses (e.g. cases of ableism where the AutoMod doesn't catch it, the occasional ""yOu HAvE rULeS?!!1one!"" trolls we sometimes get, a polite gender neutrality reminder, referring a user to the 101 sub, etc.).",selftext,/r/Anarchism/comments/wst2w7/reddits_anti_evil_operations_update_moderator/,Anarchism

The word government is actually something that should probably be avoided when discussing left vs right wing politics, instead, it should be Pro Hierarchy, on the right, and Anti Hierarchy on the left.

Anarchy is the furthest left ideology since we despise the idea of any non consensual hierarchical structures. The rest of the left, as far as I can tell, see the usefulness of having a central hierarchy that sides with the proletariat in order to create a less hierarchical system.

While I don't agree with this, since it's easy for for central hierarchies to be subverted and controlled no matter how much power is initially given to the people. This is why Tankies and other ""Authoritarian leftists"" are not leftists. 

No matter how generous your leaders are, if they are in charge without your permission, they're a ruler and an intrenched hierarchy, that is susceptible to take over. This has always been my issue with communism, the end goal of communism is to have a stateless system, but the way they want to go about it is with the consolidation of power and resources. If the government owns everything, it's no different than having a king, no matter what other steps there are in the process of government.

So while I find other leftists misguided, I don't think of them as evil or even really wrong. But Tankies, are just the far right in a different hat.",selftext,/r/Anarchism/comments/wsp5iq/tankies_are_not_leftists_no_matter_how_generous/,Anarchism

While many define schools as simply places where you go to learn things, others define schools as a manipulative learning institution meant to bend underdeveloped minds to conform to the status quo.

Personally, I think if someone in an anarchist community wants to open a cooking school or mathematics school or whatever, they should be allowed to, but it must be run democratically by teachers, students, and staff alike, and of course must not be run for profit.

Of course some people are better than others, that's just the rule of nature.""

I'm pretty sure the suggestion ""society is not natural"" won't work because of the conservative Christian takeover; suggesting the world isn't natural is the same as suggesting there is no God.

I've been reading a lot of theory as of late, and while it has been very informative and provided useful ways of understanding the state, capitalism, colonization, and other forms of oppression, needless to say, reading about how the creative energy and freedom of humanity has been crushed over time and across the world isn't exactly very uplifting.

I know I'm not the only one who wonders things like this, but sometimes I still think, what's the point? Nearly everyone I know has capitalist realism ingrained in their thinking, and even my more left-leaning friends still see the need for a state. And even if people managed to gather enough insurrectionary force to poke a hole in their systems of oppression, it seems other states would rush to crush it as soon as it presents a threat (especially in a police state like the US). 

I guess all this is to say, what reason do we have to keep fighting, when it doesn't seem like I'll see any victories in my lifetime, or for who knows how long? Don't get me wrong, I don't want this to come across as ""What's the point in living?"", because even in a world like this, I can come up with plenty of answers for that. But what about the struggle for anarchy? Are there any examples of relatively recent anarchist victories, even something small, that we can draw inspiration from?

The following is likely to be a jumbled mess of thoughts on Prison Abolition and my still forming, and largely uneducated position on it, as it stands now.

I have in the past called myself an anarchist, but as of writing, when pressed, would probably call myself a libertarian socialist who takes most ideological influences from anarchist theory. My main break with the label of anarchism is on the issue of prison abolition. While i fully agree with the positions of anarchists regarding the harmful effects of prisons, the solutions to antisocial behavior seem to me to be somewhat incomplete or somewhat utopian. It is not uncommon (although not likely the norm) to see anarchists advocate for the complete and total freedom of all those incarcerated on the very day that the revolution is won. ""Open the Prison doors"" ""Let free all those who have been imprisoned and let them live with us, guided only through solidarity and comradeship"" declares many an anarchist. The view of the total abolition of prisons, of any institution that separates the antisocial from society (and immediately upon the raising of the black flag, i might add) seems too a priori and has little consideration for the pragmatic, and of experimentation. 

While I fully agree that the cure for antisocial behavior is not separating people from their only tether to spirit of humanism and morality - society, friendship, community - and abolishing any form of carceralism seems an ideal end goal, immediately (at least in my mind) this bumps against the wall of practicality. Any sane and just society will need to protect the vulnerable from those who wish to do harm, this much is without question. Upon consideration of the facts of our historical moment, and upon understanding the harmful effects of prison, one must come to the conclusion that for some time during and after a hypothetical revolution, prisons as an institution will need to exist in one form or another. Prisons breed violence, on this point we are all in agreement. Being subject to the authority of totally impersonal penal system; locked up with other violent people where your survival may well depend on you being able to commit violence against some who wishes to harm you; being separated from family, community, society and being deprived of any agency, will or individuality; will inevitably breed the conditions the penal system wishes to stamp out. Prisons inherently breeds broken, antisocial, nihilistic and opportunist individuals and simply abolishing the state and capitalism will not immediately solve the problems created or reinforced by the carceral system. 

So, the revolution has been accomplished. all the vestiges of class society; of obedience and authority have been swept away and those who have struggle to achieve this have come to the anarchist understanding, have developed themselves to associate with one another freely, who sees in their neighbor an equal and not an enemy, the question returns to prisoners. It is likely that if a revolution were to occur, prisoners will have a minor role, or will otherwise not be able to fully develop themselves to become anti-authoritarian, due to the fact that if they try prisoners will likely be thrown into solitary confinement until the revolution has already been won. They will still have the vestiges that the penal system has thrust upon them, and simply put, to release them would be a danger to society and a fledgling transformative justice system is not likely to correct or even handle the  2.19 million brutalized people that will be introduced to it. 

So, with all that said, i will continue to the admittedly uneducated and likely ill-informed proposal i have. In my view, after the revolution this is what I would see as an appropriate solution:

1. Organize all those who have skills in social work, psychotherapy, and rehabilitation and put them into prisons to try and reform as many people in there as possible. Allow all prisoners unregulated visitation, measured community integration, meaningful work, and access to resources for the development of any creative passions or intellectual interests.
2. Immediately release all nonviolent offenders as soon as sufficient rehabilitative programs have been established in the various communities of which they will return to.
3. Build new rehabilitative prisons based on the Norwegian model for all those incarcerated for violent offenses for them to be transferred to. These will not be for punishment, but purely to house them as they received the aforementioned treatment.
4. Each offender will gradually be allowed greater and greater, phased, reintroduction and reintegration to the community, being granted once professionals have deemed them safe enough.
5. Gradually abolish these institutions as the reorganization of the economy and of social life as a whole makes them unnecessary, but only as long as these institutions have become unnecessary and dealing with antisocial behavior can be totally dealt with without prisons.

Therefore my view is one in which experience, experimentation and empirical observations will be the stopcock on the advancement of prison abolition. That only when the last vestiges of class society have been swept into the dustbin of history will the existence of prisons will become an extinct relic of a bygone and savage era. In my view we must always temper our ideological commitments with the facts laid before us in our particular historical moment. Our moral convictions are strong, but we must always allow our path to be guided by experience and experimentation until, finally, we reach our desired society - step by step: through successes, failures, false starts and setbacks. Until then we will have to contend with the systems laid before us, and which we inherit from previous eras.

In short, the abolition of prisons should be achieved only when the societal and material conditions we find ourselves in make it possible. To do otherwise will only condemn us to failure in this matter, and risks us returning to a penal system (and possibly back to the current state of social organization) as these failures breed in the minds of man a desire for a return to the ""Good old days"". I feel we must accept that it may take decades or even a century to fully correct the effects of class society and social organization based on authority, but the duration of struggle doesn't matter so long as we keep marching forward to a *truly* free and equal society.

In the 1910s, anarchist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn suggested [(text here)](https://archive.iww.org/history/library/Flynn/Sabotage/) that sabotage was the 'withdrawal of worker efficiency' and that it represents ""the guerrilla warfare, the day-by-day warfare between two opposing classes."" In the early 1990s, anarcho-punk Martin Sprouse brought this concept forward with his [Sabotage in the American Workplace](https://libcom.org/article/sabotage-american-workplace-anecdotes-dissatisfaction-mischief-and-revenge), where he claimed ""There I was in a typical American office, witnessing sabotage done by almost every level of staff.

Sabotage was part of most employees daily routines, and so widespread that it was barely noticeable.""

I'm thinking mainly of corporate service work here - big stores, fast food places, warehouses/delivery, etc. Obviously in some lines of work, especially caring work like medical, the concept might not have much relevance. But for the most common kinds of service jobs today, the possibilities for sabotage seem ripe.

Ive heard the argument before that anarchists and other leftists should dogwhistle like the right does, but I disagree. The right is successful with dogwhistles because they prey on the preconceived biases that already exist within popular society, especially among whites. Anarchists dont have that weapon because they oppose all that bigoted social conditioning.

In my opinion, anarchists dont need to dogwhistle, nor do they need better optics, they need diversity so that there is no longer a single image of anarchism, because in truth there isnt one. Anarchism is the black bloc saboteur smashing car windows, the volunteer at mutual aid initiatives, the tree hugging hippie, the rural white trash that protects their communities, and the spoiled rich kid who reads too much theory, all at the same time.

Worldwide and especially in America and Europe, ultra-right, conservative and partly already openly fascist groups are gaining strength. 

It is up to us to lead the fight for a better world, but how can that work without a local network of like-minded people? 

Anti-fascist work (research, outings, actions, planning, visits, etc.) has always had a clandestine character. Not without reason, because our enemies are everywhere! 
Nevertheless, the antifascist movement needs to open up worldwide in order to reach like-minded people more easily and to create a broader network. 

For this reason, you and your group should also organise an Open Antifascist Meeting (OAM).


But what should such an OAM offer? 

First of all, the OAM should offer a platform for exchange and networking among antifascists and other left-wing people. 

The OAMs in my city are organised by motivated people on a self-supporting basis and consist of five parts.

1. exchange among the participants
2. theoretical input on antifascist topics or antifascist work.
3. practical part in the form of a workshop or an action.
4. information on anti-fascist work done and outed fascists in the group area.
5. planning of the next OAM

This is our form of an OAM, how your OAM should take place is up to the participants and can be arranged freely in principle. 


What do you need to hold an OAM?

First of all, you need a room that offers enough space and security.

You should also think about how you can make interested people aware of your OAM. This works well on the internet or through street posters, flyers and stickers.

Last but not least, you should offer some snacks and non-alcoholic drinks so that the interested people are also somewhat fed.


If you live in an area that is already infested with fascists, you should urgently take some protective measures.

Among other things, you should keep the location of the event secret and not advertise it. Instead, list a secure email address on the advertisement through which interested people can register for the OAM. On this registration form, you can then send the address of a lock point in the vicinity, where you can pick up interested people and send them to the event location. 


You should also protect yourselves from state or private repression:

It is best if all participants hand over their smartphones so that you can ensure that no one films or records sensitive content.

 It is also important that you are careful with names etc. to protect yourselves from spies. Only open up to people you perceive as trustworthy.

In general, you should try not to disclose sensitive information about your antifascist work (especially illegal actions) unless you already have a relationship of trust with the people present.

If you have problems with violent fascists in your region, it is advisable to organise a small protection force.



Our OAM has two online chats through a secure provider (Signal). One is the general OAM chat, where all interested visitors can sign in, and the other is the OAM organization chat, where motivated and trustworthy people can be added to plan the next OAM. 

These chats help us to organize and mobilize for upcoming events and actions. 


With this knowledge you should be able to organize an OAM in your place. If you have any questions I will be happy to answer them in the comments.

Well then, to the work comrade!

I am an anarchist, and of course I will not hesitate to say ACAB, no crapitalism or state etc.

My family is all of those hated things. My dad is a cop. For over a decade now. He is extremely nationalistic, and trusts the government here to the maximum, pro-life, anti LGBT. He thinks people should be oppressed for the greater good (literally wtf?). I do not agree with his stances at all. He also is an abuser, he cheated at least three times and hit my mom till she was almost deaf and they divorced then. 

My mom owns a company. She constantly says theyre understaffed, so I suggested that she give out higher wages because shes asking for someone with at least a bachelors degree, hopefully masters, but the starting salary is barely enough to survive (like more than half would go to rent alone) and workload is very high and tiring. I know she has enough to pay more. She owns so many luxury goods, earned by profits she got from wage slaves. She looked at me as if I was saying ridiculous words. I would work in her company, but thats because Im the only one that she pays fairly, since Im her kid.

She also started a charity to help the youth, but I know her primary goal is for the profit. Donations go to her own company, which is in the education industry, and she uses this as an excuse to help the youth while she is profiting from it. She is an influencer of some sorts as well. Sometimes she includes me in her TikToks without permission. I hate it so much.

Grandparents are either nationalist politicians or military. 

I feel so conflicted. I actually feel bad because all the products I use are from money that was profited from wage slaves.

Unfortunately, most of the solutions that people suggest are unworkable because they are wedded to the status quo and are more focused on furthering the interest of various elite groups rather than the public as a whole. I'm hoping that we can come up with some ideas for reinventing the news industry by approaching this from a radical, anarchist perspective.

By 'news industry', I mean the institutions that communicate general public-interest information among strangers. I don't mean to imply that it necessarily requires specialists (i.e. journalists), and I'm definitely not implying a capitalist structure. I'm thinking of this as something separate from communication among acquaintances or within organized groups, though that distinction may not be helpful.

For some background, the news industry as we know it today [traces its origins to around \~1600](https://art19.com/shows/tides-of-history/episodes/55bfcce1-a67e-4cb6-b647-0c7d684c6ec5) when mechanical presses were first used to mass-print sheets of general-interest news. Before that, long-distance news was typically spread by private correspondence among elites; if most people had access to printed 'news', it was often just announcements from authority figures.

What are the important features of a good news industry? I'll put some thoughts below to get the discussion started.

I think it's probably critical that the 'news' be publicly accessible - there should be no paywalls or other artificial barriers to access. Nor should any secret algorithms sit between a person an the news they consume. This is important both for inclusion and so that misleading information can be challenged. 

I think it's also important that everyone have the ability to publish the news that they think is important, but this may be easier said than done, especially when you consider the importance of good editing and distribution networks.

A good information system will also encourage/enable active participation by consumers. This includes opportunities to fact check and correct errors.

by ADOADP

Preface

Ontarnv is a political ideology developed by somebody. It believes in many facets which will be explained thoroughly in this text.

Part the First: Meta-Anarchism

The first facet of Ontarnv is Meta-Anarchism. Meta-Anarchism is a strain of political thought developed in the 1970s in France. It believes that there is no universal solution to every problem in the universe, and any attempt to impose a universal order is inherently oppressive. 

It attempts to instead implement a plurality of societies, which it calls a collage, a kaleidoscopic disorganized organism of free-flowing cultures and novel societies. 

Akin to a group of children playing without direction, inventing novel ideas, and grouping in the free flow of joy. This is better than forcing all to follow one doctrine or set of rules.

We are opposed to borders, property lines, flags, and Nationalism, which restrict the free flow of people, cultures, and ideas.

Part the Second: Futurism

Futurism is an Italian artistic movement from the 20th century, and a defining cultural feature of Ontarnv. 

Futurism rejects anything and everything that has to do with the past, and believes in a violent and furious overthrow of the chains of old.

An embrace of violence, speed, youth, and a full overthrow of old Neo-Reactionary society is necessary to harrow in a new age.

We believe in the extreme acceleration of technology, the exploration of space, and the liberation of all from biological constraints placed by a cruel god.

Part the Third: Fully Decentralized Matter Creator

Anti-Capitalist and Anti-Communist, the ideal economic conditions for Ontarnv hold further and further decentralization, with the ultimate utopian goal being a single device which can hold the might of an industrialized economy on one person. 

Nobody shall own land, sky, or water, but instead merely occupy the land on which they are standing, the air they are breathing, and the water they are drinking.

With the FDMC, one can wander the lands, and no longer be restricted by the need to be in a large society for economic sustainability.

The optimal human size of relations is a group of under 200 people. This decentralized fashion is, in the authors opinion, the perfect size.

With progress, technology tends to become smaller and more compact. So it is not remotely unlikely that we will see a shrink in the amount of external support one human needs to thrive.

Part the Fourth: 

 is the inconceivable and impossibly infinite conscious being known as the universe. Represented to every being in a different form, it came to me as an ouroboros circling a black sun. 

 is every spoke of the wheel and the ground it rolls over

everything and nothing

everyone and nobody

During massive protests or street battles with police, how do you defend against police dogs?

I have heard several arguments about this. There is a school of thought that says, police dogs are still cops, but with teeth and the ability to tear into you or kill you and should be treated just as we treat human police during conflict.

The alternative, one that I agree with, is that they are abused animals, emotionally and physically, to become cop dogs and should be handled with care or defended against/disabled in a way that does not hurt them because it's not their fault that they are cops.

Well, yes, but thats not the whole story.

The reason I am posting this is because their civilizations are the closest thing to unbothered anarchy I have seen.

So last year I went homeless and I went to an area my partner had lived in before. He told me it was beautiful and peaceful, but there are feral people there. Exhausted and optionless, we went. And it was beautiful. We could do whatever we wanted and for a while we didnt contact anyone else. We spent our days fishing stripped bass, cracking blood quartz geodes, and playing with our neighbors dogs. Well then the day came that I met my first feral person. I was up on the trail, waiting for my partner, and this dude walked past with ripped clothes and a fishing pole. He said oh I must have scared you and I replied that he didnt that Im just waiting for someone. He then told me that one of the other people stole his hatchet and he planed to kill the person who did. I told him if I see it Ill but it in the hollow trunk of this one tree. Well, later that night he stole both my partner and Is wallets and proceeded to skip into town for a few days and pull a lot of fraud while we were off the grid. We instantly hated this dude. He later stole my hammock and our weed. We would pace around our camp at night so we would fuck with him and fake having a gun when all we had were melee weapons. We would carve messages on trees to communicate with each other and all the other feral people in the area. We also had a weird like, almost animalistic language we would use to communicate across long distances.

Skipping past other events, eventually we moved across the state, and we gave him the last our rations, our shelter, and even a pair of shoes.

This community has been living a more primal, anarchist culture for nearly 100 years. Its amazing and so incredibly freeing, but murder is commonplace and starvation and violence due to it.

Its a very survival of the fittest culture.
And I respect it.

Id that dude tried to kill me id kill him and no one would be there to care or even hear him scream.

The essence of it is that Im having a hard time reconciling my beliefs.

On the one hand, I have always been critical of capitalism, and critical of geopolitical grandstanding, questioned the validity of laws and nations and their arbitrary borders, and the destruction of nature. I am upset by exploitation and abuse of people.

Ive never done anything to fight any of it, mind you, but Ive always held those beliefs and theyve shaped much of my thinking.

On the other hand, I like nice things. I am a consumer and I actively participate in capitalism.

Despite knowing that my computer is assembled from materials that are extracted in a destructive and exploitative way, built in a factory that exploits its workers, and sold on a market that exploits the consumer - I like having it and using it.

The same can be said for my phone, my smart lights, and my Converse sneakers stitched together by the hands of Vietnamese children in a sweat shop.

Not to put too fine a point on it: I enjoy being able to have things which make my life easier, better and more comfortable.

I am, in essence, aware of being a hypocrite in this regard: Waxing philosophical about the evils of how the modern world is shaped, written on an iPhone built in a factory where there are suicide nets outside the windows to prevent workers from creating a PR oopsie.

I hate everything that Amazon represents - the wholesale destruction of brick-and-mortar small businesses, the inhuman abuses of its workers, and a smorgasbord of disgusting behaviour. Yet, I often reach for the convenience it provides because finding an alternative in my region is like squeezing blood from a stone.

I work in IT at a large financial institution - the most vile, socially destructive and unethical industry. But the pay is good, the benefits are good, the workload is small, and I can cruise by with minimal stress and effort to bring home a pay check 7x that of a school teacher.

I dont know how to reconcile my anarchist-leaning beliefs with the social conditioning I have, and the reality of living in the modern world where the game has been rigged and I stand to lose by fighting it.

Im expecting unkind words for this post. Perhaps Im outing myself as not-an-anarchist, or not radical enough, or as being complicit in the problem whilst paying lip service to the solution.

I am hoping for constructive criticism and direction.",selftext,/r/Anarchism/comments/wnif1q/i_am_an_anarchist_and_a_hypocrite_and_i_need_to/,Anarchism

I don't think there is another functioning way to organise an economy, since planned economy is not only undemocratic but also evidently doesn't work (see Soviet Union etc.).

 Im a canvasser with Working Americas Pennsylvania office (WAPA).

This past week during one of our routine morning briefings when we attempted to address several concerns weve had with management, including but not limited to working during heatwaves without any safety protocol in place when the heat index is dangerously high, sexual harassment in our workplace where the offender has virtually remained unpenalized and continues to make others uncomfortable, as well as wage theft and refusal to reimburse and/or compensate workers asked to drive for gas or tickets they've acquired. Additionally lgbtq and non-white workers are routinely endangered and met with hostility in neighborhoods they are made to canvas.
When we were finally able to get management to leave the room for a few minutes so that we could speak privately with our co-workers about these issues and establish our terms, they tried to intimidate us with police force and several members of management began attempting to physically stop workers from filming the incident.
We will be striking tomorrow (Friday, 8/12) at noon outside of Working Americas Philadelphia office in the Germantown section of Northwest Philadelphia and would love and appreciate any support and if you can make it, please wear a red shirt in solidarity and bring whatever signs you would like.

We are part of the kingdom animalia, the class mammalia, and the family homonidae. But whether or not humans are animals, in the sense that humans and other animals are one in the same, is often debated.

Here's how I see it: the human race is not separate from nature, and are certainly not separate from animals. We, just like the other creatures of the earth, have our own superpowers that has helped our species survive. Like how alligators have the powers of stealth and a ludicrous bite force and how vultures have the power of owning a stomach that kills bacteria, humans have the powers of (arguably) the highest intelligence in the animal kingdom, opposable thumbs, and the ability to stand upright. These 3 things were what allowed us to dominate the world.

The same oppressive institutions that control and have controlled humanity for centuries are the same ones that have separated humans from nature: Creationist theocracies and their anthropocentric and pseudo-scientific teachings, deforestation and pollution under capitalism, mass animal farming, the hunting of animals for sport rather than food, etc. In order for humans to be able to be part of nature again, all unjustified hierarchies need to be abolished.

I understand there are a lot of Western double standards regarding this stuff. A notable example being the double standard on civilians using Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian civilians are hailed as heroes for making Molotovs but Palestinian kids are called terrorists for throwing rocks. I don't know if it's a race thing or just a geopolitical favoritism thing, or both. What's obvious is that there's a double standard.

Still, I feel like supporting Ukraine defending itself against Russia is something that most Palestinians would naturally support. But I've definitely seen people support Russia simply out of spite and anger at the double standards. 

However, it does warm my heart that I've seen many Twitter accounts that have both a Ukraine flag and Palestine flag in their bio. I think the pro-Russia sentiment might be more limited to Reddit.

A couple friends and I have started doing extreme weather outreach with unhoused communities in our city.

Also, on a related note, I'm very crafty and have been putting that to use with mutual aid. The past two years I've sewn and crocheted a lot of winter gear for unhoused people.

I'm curious what you guys think of them.

**Idea #1: Direct Polling**

The basic idea is similar to the reddit frontpage.  Users can create posts called ""propositions"" (as in a logical proposition, or a statement that is or should be true or false).  These posts would be shown on the home page of some website, and people can up-vote or down-vote propositions based on how important they think it is that we achieve consensus on that proposition (*not* based on whether they agree or disagree with it - i.e. if you agree *or* disagree strongly with a proposition you should up-vote it so it gets more visibility).  Comments on each proposition are then broken down into two streams: agreement comments and disagreement comments.  If you don't have anything new to say, you can just up-vote the comment(s) you think best represent the argument for your position (on either the agree or disagree side).  That way users who visit the site are presented with a list of propositions ordered by how relevant people think they are, with each proposition having comments both supporting and disagreeing with it (and clearly marked as such) ordered by how relevant people think the arguments are.

**Idea #2: Dynamic Inclusive Representation**

This one isn't entirely direct democracy... Sort of direct/representative democracy hybrid... The idea would be that *everyone* has to meet with a group of \~10 people to discuss how society is going and whether we need any new rules or any existing rules need to be revised.  At the end of the meeting you compile notes on what you think the most important action items are and elect one of the 10 people to move forward into the next round.  If elected into the next round you have to find \~10 people who were *also* elected to represent their first-round group in the second round.  At the end of the second round, groups elect 1/10 to move to the third round, then fourth round, etc.  Eventually you have &lt;10 people who have (ideally) condensed the most important issues of everyone they represented throughout the process.  They vote, rules are amended, the process repeats \~1/year.

Importantly at each round the participants get to self-organise into groups that best align with their priorities such that as each round progresses the highest priority issues get carried forward.

If you did that annually, then 90% of the population would have to meet only once a year, 9% of the population would have to meet twice a year, 0.9% of the population three times a year, 0.09% of the population would meet four times a year, 0.009% of the population would meet five times a year, 0.0009% of the population would meet six times a year, etc.

After \~10 rounds you're at 0.00000009% of the population (or \~7 people) - so people would have to meet at least once a year and at most once a month, and everyone's issues are heard in the process (even if they can't all be carried forward).",selftext,/r/Anarchism/comments/wkgobt/practical_anarchistdirect_democracy/,Anarchism

I actually went the other direction to your question, from a ml communist, to a socialist, to an anarchist. Mostly because of the anarchist philosophy on hierarchy, ie there should be none. 

I appreciate this philosophy now after struggling with it, because I, like many of you believe that the benefits of hierarchy such as: organization, informational flow and quick reaction, distribution of labor, specialization and cooperation are valuable tenets to creating an ideal society. I used to think that the best way to accomplish these goals was with an authoritarian, top-down approach. A leader dictates their vision and creates systems to distribute the work within their society to try and accomplish their vision. So the definition of a hierarchy. But the more I learned about this world and the various systems of government that have ruled it throughout history, the more I keep coming back to hierarchy and the fact that a hierarchy and a hierarchical society is only as good and as efficient as it's leader is benevolent and competent. 

From chiefs, priests, kings, presidents, and general secretaries, no matter what you call it, the seat of leadership and the power that comes with it is a tool designed for good but all too frequently used for evil. 

To deny the evils of hierarchical societies of any sort is to deny history and reality. The harsh truth is that there are moral and competent leaders who take their societies to new heights, but they only rule for so long, and then their void and the reins to society are a target for evil people, or a burden which crushes the incompetent and their society with them.

But even the most moral leaders must do evil things, simply by being rulers of a hierarchy. For example, one thing I can't stand about hierarchies of any sort is the necessity for what I call ""the shit group"". The bottom of the social pyramid, the shit group are the lowest of the low. They are at once loaded with the heaviest burdens of society and the cruelest punishment. Because of this I will never stand by a hierarchical society, because without the cruelty imposed on a shit group the whole thing falls apart. 

The shit group serve the social role as both a threat against descent, ie ""obey and behave or you will be like them"" and as a justification for the middle classes for the hierarchical system, ie ""my life is bad but at least I'm not them."" They are also frequently made to do the hardest, lowest, but most valuable jobs in the society with the worst compensation. Growing/making food, building anything from life giving infrastructure, to monuments, cleaning cities, homes and sewers, fighting in wars, doing any odd, humiliating, back breaking labor no one else wants to do. 

The shit group are then kept in place with state sanctioned violence and general public apathy or malice to their situation. Because in a hierarchy the biggest threats are internal, and almost always stem from turmoil in the lower classes. That is why they fight twice as hard against a rebellion verses an invasion. Because without a base the whole pyramid falls. 

Which is why I appreciate Marx, his writings and his theory. He did the unthinkable and made people realize that ""YOU, YES YOU"" are in the shit group. He made people see that they were living the lives of slaves and it wasn't because of some natural order but because of the corruption of their leaders. He showed them the violence they faced, the exploitation, humiliation, starvation, fear and pain weren't necessary or right. This suffering was a part of their lives simply because their rulers needed it that way. 

Which is also why I don't like Lenin. He took Marx's words, spread them and formed a liberation army of the oppressed of Russia. He defeated a tyrant and freed millions, but what did he do after that; he created a tyranny and slaves with a new name. 

I admit many did see improvement in their lives and rights after the fall of the Tzar but they were still the shit group. They worked back breaking hours in factories instead of fields, they starved due to rationing instead of cruel taxes, and if they descented they were sent by force to the exact same gulags the Tzar used but this time the men wore red and had AKs instead of wearing white and with rifles. 

What revolutionary leaders like Stalin, Lenin, Mao and others should have done after they won is loosen authority not tighten it. Because even beyond my objections to authority and hierarchy, revolutionaries make shit rulers. 

They just aren't the same position. A ruler must be led by his people to make the best decisions for them as a whole. A revolutionary is a general who doesn't listen but is listened too for better or worse. Not only that by the meer fact of them being soldiers they are trumatized because of their fight and therefore much more likely to succumb to the disasterous influence of paranoia. 

Their trauma and revolutionary mindset leads to constant fear of crisis leads and to paranoia, they try to fix this with enhancement of the military when they should focus on their peoples comfort, then they move to imperialism to expand borders for buffers and resources for military improvement and sooth social unrest, the paranoia can also become overwhelming and exhasting, which causes a desire for escape, an escape into the pleasures and excesses they now have in their reach. Self-service and enrichment at the cost of their people, this leads to turmoil and the leader to enact harsher authority and the possible creation of a shit group to maintain their power, leading to a false sense of security and a superiority complex and to more curroption, self-service, cruelty, until the system and the people have no energy, nor choice but to over throw the bloated crushing weight of their oppressor.

This is why I believe communist countries suffered some of the worst disasters and caused some of the worst atrocities because their leaders had the same mindset that won them the revolution. They had a goal and were willing to pay any cost to achieve it, even the lives of millions of people, even it that goal was wrong because they would not listen to concerns or dissent, but also they quickly became paranoid and fell into the cycle i described above. 

Secret police, brutal authority, imperialism, unnecessary wars, famine, disasterous economic policy, all the things communist leaders fought against they repeated. Simply because they were not cut out for the power they should have destroyed. 

So no I can't be a ML they have shown through their own actions that they maintain the cruelty of hierarchies and fall into the same traps as any other leader. Even though their original vision was good, once they were in power the absolute authority they held corrupted them just as it would anyone else. It's not even shocking as they are merely human. With unchecked authority and massive wealth at your finger tips it's only natural for your selfless morals to errode into self-service and your vision of altruism and communism to crumble into paranoia and iron fisted authority as you fear someone will take your beautiful wealth, intoxicating power away from you. 

I believe that it is just to fight against oppression as Marx and Lenin did but upon victory you can't take the seat of your oppressor. The evil you fought was born from greed, curroption, arrogance and lost empathy. All things that exist in the heart of every human and that are grown with absolute power. To destroy them or deny them is like trying to destroy or deny the human desire for freedom. You can't destroy part of human nature without destroying yourself. You must destroy the force that brings human evils to the forefront.

I believe a freer society results from statelessness. Without a hierarchy there can be no corrupted leaders and no shit group. Only equals doing what they love with who they love. 

But I know what your thinking. ""Such a society sounds nice, but it seems so easy for a bad actor to rise and recreate a hierarchy for their own gain."" And you are right, peace, equality and cooperation aren't enough for some. There will be bad actors who see soft targets and try to take a beautiful thing for themselves. 

My response to a coordinated effort from a bad actor to recreate a hierarchy would be to organize a counter offensive and defend what is most valuable to us. If you think I am suggesting we create a hierarchy to fight this force of hierarchy you are exactly right that is what I am suggesting.

A criticism I am comfortable leveling at anarchists is recognizing that a hierarchy is a tool and an effective one. 

As I mentioned before hierarchies are incredible at solving a focused goal. They are the most organized human social structure, they are the best at relaying information and orders quickly, they distribute and specialize labor to make physical changes quick and efficient, they harness the power of human cooperation to do amazing things. To do the unthinkable we must organize. To defend against a bad actor we must form a structured army. 

Again the point of failure is the leader, with incompetent or cruel leaders your odds of failure rise. But failure is always a possibility and honestly for a single goal, hierarchy is the best tool against it. So even with all the organization in the world you still must pray that your leader and the odds are in your favor. 

So yes hierarchies are necessary but they shouldn't be mandatory nor used outside of very specific circumstances, and the only acceptable circumstance would be a crisis. 

First on the subject of mandate, a thing I really enjoy about anarchism is its core belief of consent. That a person can and should consent to every aspect of their society. That I think is beautiful. To be able to choose not only how you live your life, what rules you live under, but what projects to focus a societies collective will on, as well as the freedom to choose how much and who you wish to help. 

It is encouraged you help as it helps the society at large and a greater chance you will receive help in return but even still it is not required. Because your consent, your autonomy, matters. Without full freedom to choose, there is no cooperation only coercion. And in my experience given a real choice people often help more not less because they use their autonomy to become invested and gain greater satisfaction seeing improvements they chose. 

But maximizing your autonomy doesn't come without a cost. It also maximizes your responsibility. Another thing anarchists struggle with is wanting the freedom but none of the burden of that freedom. In addition to the having a society that guarantees freedom to live your life your way, you are also responsible for making tough decisions if you want to ensure it stays that way. 

Such a society is a fragile thing so it requires all it's citizens to be vigilant. For example a possible threat to equitablity might be food shortages. People may become desperate and resort to violence and theat to survive. If you enjoy an equal society it is in your best interest that doesn't happen, to prevent your society from deteriorating you share your food even if it means you have less so desperation isn't reached. Again you don't have to, but it may put cracks in the beautiful thing you built. If you care about an anarchist society's survival you must be responsible and kind.

But sometimes you must also be harsh. If a crime is committed it is up to you if you value your society to be part of the judgement, whether it is punishment or kindness. You have to take part in the difficult act of condemning your fellow man. For as soon as you decide you can't handle that responsibility and want someone else to do it, congratulations you've created a single entity with the responsibilities you should undertake, in essence you've created a state.

Not only is responsibility necessary it is also kind. By spreading the vigilance through out a society you avoid that burden being placed on one leader and creating paranoia and corruption. Similarly the collectivzation of judgement means power and authority corrupts no one as all such a process in hard on the mind and soul, but also even though you have power in your word and your vote it is checked by everyone else who has the same power. Freedom is a fragile thing but one that must be protected by all to keep. 

I believe in anarchism and I believe all people deserve a choice in their lives. I worry that perhaps many are not ready nor will they ever be to also shoulder the burden such freedom requires. But I hope that with kindness and slow change perhaps we can make people strong enough to rule themselves. 

Next on the topic of condition, the best way to survive a crisis is organization. Whether it's attack, natural disaster, disease, or any other short term calamity; a single vision, distributed and specialized labor, and quick action maximize survival. But outside of crisis power and hierarchy should be put aside. For the above mentioned reasons if it is maintained it will inevitably lead to a cycle of corruption, cruelty, social decay and revolution. 

To have a hierarchy outside of a tangible crisis assumes that there is always a crisis even when there is none. This simple fact is what creates the corruption I discussed above. 

To have a hierarchy as a structure for your society assumes that peace for all is never possible and that your people can't be trusted to lead themselves. When neither is true. Humans are a communal, cooperative species. We would not be here if that were not the case. We take care of each other we don't need someone to take care of us. 

Time and time again we've seen it. The slaves in the ancient world and in colonial America, feudal peasants, fascist inferiors, capitalist laborors, today's third world, and communist proletariat. The oppressed topple the oppresser and take their seat and do it again. It's always assumed that for society people need to be contained and threatened. For many to bear the brunt of society, while few enjoy the wealth and power. Because what other way is there? What other way has there been? But after these attempts perhaps the answer is ""do we need to be ruled?""

I believe to truely realize the society Marx envisioned we must realize that a hierarchy will eventually always lead to a ruler that is cruel and incompetent which will lead to a cruel and inhumane world. The best way to make a peaceful world is to take power from one and give it to all.

And of course all my friends have been toxic and family cant help. Keep in mind, I have attempted to kms 7 different times in the past 2 years and have struggled through many bouts of deep, dark depression and ideation, including one now, jus to set the record straight for context of the conflict I am feeling rn.

Anyways, I am a recent convert to anarcho-nihilism // anarcho-communism, something of the two, not sure just yet, from state communism and MLism. I say recent like that because A-N // A-Cm was my original selection, I just got a bit sidetracked and persuaded into ML-ism for a bit. Dunno. And I kinda feel that way because of my very rough life so far, and how thats impacted me to this day.

But, for about 3 years now, I have been trying to figure out what the hell to do with my life, even before I really got into politics. Ive gone over every possible option you can think of, ranging from NEETdom to vanlife to digital nomad, or whatever hip millennial lifestyle there is. But I have recently touched my situation, and upon very close inspection and ignoring daydreaming, my realistic choices are more either: straight up homelessness, vagabonding, or a combo of the two in houselessness (kinda like backpacking). The issue with most of my ideas is that, being the socially anxious, gay, autistic, ADHD, BPD, depressed, semi-disabled (cerebral palsy) ass that I am, it could be very unlikely that I could ever be in a position of temporary employment, let alone a permanent career, to my knowledge of the situation. Combined with the fact my parents wont let me get even a starter job, its insanely hard, and I want to get out of AmeriKKKa, but I really cannot at the moment, despite my wishes. 

Not only is academia getting way harder for me and my grades are struggling as a result, but college abroad isnt even an option for me, due to my parents refusal and my unwillingness to go into millions of debt to attempt to pay it off. So Im kinda screwed: I cannot really leave, yet I cannot really stay.

Ive thought about doing some sort of thing related to anarchy, like the CCF or the FAI, but that would land me in serious international jeopardy most likely, or joining a commune like the one in Niederkaufungen, but I have doubts if anyone will actually accept me, as I can work, but not to the extent a regular physical job requires (parents push for engineering or HVAC but Im dumb AF).
So, Im kinda at a loss for what to do with my life right now, short of packing shit up and trainhopping all around the country. I *could* go up to Canada, but thatd cause immigration issues, and I *could* apply for SSI here if I go to SF or Portland OR, but I dont think Im eligible. I *could* go over to Europe and see whats available there, but then I have to worry about the Schengen and the languages (ich spreche ein kleines bisschen Deutsche y un poco espaol) and the flight costsI could also go down to Latin America, but I dont know how well that will go and I simply cannot drive,  unfortunately. So, I dont really know what do at the moment, but I dont really expect you to, either.

I just know it cant be in the middle of bumfuck nowhere USA where I currently am. Im a blank slate that can do some things kinda well and I dont really have a future, backed up by my nihilistic viewpoint on life, or much ways of attaining one, as far as I can see right now in this context of such a miserable place I can do nada about. Forget about being skilled at anything, Im useless. Id ask for advice but Im not very sure many of you know what to do to help or anything, and I know as much as you do.

I just aint giving up. I just cannot. I dont really have a grand vision for my life (other than helping the anarchist cause), nor any major aspirations, and Im trying to make the best of a shit situation, I know, but its hard when Ive been givven some the most shit starting cards in the mental an emotional universe, i.e. Im effectively useless.

Anyways, sorry to keep you for so long.

TL;DR: gay autistic 16 AMAB tryna get out of a shitty situation with no life expierience and zero future, but is independent and adaptable and looking for advice on how to move ahead in life, committed to these political values that they hold dear. probably impossible to do such a thing, i know as much as anyone else, dont worry, you dont have to say anything if you aint wanna do such.

have a good day

So I ask since the Dems are still militarizing the police while the conservative party is blocking them while now calling to defend the FBI. Not to mention the Democratic parties love of gun control so they have even more reasons to stick cops on innocent black people.

1.) dependence on government, particularly on welfare and other services, is a ""necessary evil"" and

2.) collaboration with government is morally and/or ideologically acceptable if it leads to beneficial ends.

The first problem with this is logical consistency. All government is based on hierarchy (i.e. ranking of individuals based on superiority and inferiority in socio-political organizations) and domination (i.e. social systems in which power is held by one group over another); their existence is opposed by core classical libertarian principles, which include rejection of hierarchy and domination. You cannot justify hierarchy and domination by endorsing collaboration with government while rejecting it at the same time and remain logically consistent. Either you are an anarchist or you are not; you do not get to make up definitions based on personal convenience.

Second, the ""necessary evil"" argument in favor of collaboration with government is a false dichotomy. There are logically consistent and ethical courses of action for anarchists already in existence. These include agorism and counter-economics, gift economies and mutual aid societies to replace state functions, mass strikes and acts of sabotage to cripple industry and government, as well as a plethora of other militant or ""anti-political"" actions.

You can see from this that anarchy demands that the anarchist become \*ungovernable\* when forced to live under government, not a statist authoritarian bootlicker who makes excuses for his inactivity. Collaboration with statist authoritarians is just the cowards way out, the path of least resistance.

The third problem is support for government welfare and other services is ultimately support for the perpetuation and expansion of the hierarchy and domination that underpins all government. Many anarchists not only support government, but actively lobby for *more* of it. However, by lobbying government for more welfare and more rights, you end up with more state bureaucracy and more state enforcement. Support of and collaboration with government merely aids the state in consolidating its power and control over the masses.

This means that whatever the benefits are of having government, they are vastly outweighed by the harms. If our moral calculus is to include a risk-benefit analysis, and we factor in all of the mass murders and genocides carried out by governments throughout history, then the risks of having government vastly exceed any of the admittedly very trivial benefits. Otherwise, what would be the purpose of anarchism?

The fourth problem is that working in collaboration with government confers legitimacy on it by way of consenting to and approving of its electoral and other procedural mechanisms for achieving reform. This is of course what governments want, even if your beliefs are diametrically opposed to their existence.

The series of anarchist justifications for collaboration with government is an unethical tradeoff for dubious utilitarian ends that only serve to undermine classical libertarian principles, not reinforce them. As such, collaboration with government is counterproductive. Anarchists can only work outside government, undermining it from without, not in collaboration with it, either under it or through participation in its institutions. This would only prolong, expand and consolidate government, things that are antithetical to the anarchist goal of a world without hierarchy and domination.",selftext,/r/Anarchism/comments/wjn518/why_do_a_lot_of_anarchists_believe_that/,Anarchism

They did not let me talk and when I finally was allowed to talk I had to explain with my legs shaking how I did not have anything against them in particular and I think some sort of law enforcement is necessary but I do not like it in it's current form. I also said I do not like how cops protect capital. They said I knew nothing about the world or capitalism. I said told I was part of the local socialist youth and that I'm politically active but they ignored me. I said that it cannot be illegal to show the middle finger to a cop and they said it's not but it's very disrespectful. I had to give them my name for them to see if I had any previous in counters with the police and I did not. They forced me to personally apologise to them and to say I respect their work and that I learned something. After a few minutes and also talking to my friends they let us go. I did learn something from this. You should not mess with cops and that that they are really unpleasant. Previously I thought non US cops are not THAT bad but I think this might have changed my view.

i appreciate that as i said sometimes this writing style is needed to explain more complicated concepts, but not every word of every anarchist text ever is a complicated concept, imo its uneccesary and elitist. its ironic as well because the text we were reading at one point was talking about how elitist people in academia are while literally writing as one of those people. the comrade i mentioned studied english lit at uni and says thats the standard in those circles and that some poeple even speak like that lol. but it just doesnt make sense to me that even when theres a text aimed at school students, about how shit the school system is and how silly academics can be, that its written in that way, if that makes sense. 

its so unecessary, its anarchism, it should be easy for anyone to access anarchist theory and yet ive been an anarchist for something like 3 or 4 years now and ive not been able to finish reading even one theoretical text (beyond short intros/zines) because of this, its like its in a different language. its inacessible to the working class, those with learning disabilities, people who dont have english as their first language, etc. its really frustrating but it only seems to be me that has any issue with this? i dont like that everyone ive tried to talk about it to except the comrade i mentioned has just dismised me without considering what ive got to say, maybe thats because im a kid who knows, its still unbelievebly frustrating tho.

Though some of the more egregious examples have begun to be rectified in the past few years, for one, I have not seen the r-slur allowed anywhere near as much as it used to be, but I just feel absolutely sick of having to just put up with ablism and the outright refusal to acknowledge the lived experiences of disabled people. We have entire ideologies built around the failure to even consider the perspective of a disabled person existing, namely primitivism, an ideology that is built upon the idea that a world in which the only means we currently have to produce life saving medicines are abolished would be better for all people. Every single time I have tried to fight it I have been told the same thing by the people who run the community. I have been told that my treatment of their ablist ideas as being something other than what they explicitly say they are makes *me* in the wrong and that *I* am the one who needs to do better for taking issue with it. When I have fought against the r slur, primarily in discord servers, I have been banned on the basis of calling them ablist for using a word that demeans the neurodivergant (myself included) as inferior and as automatically lesser by nature of it. Simply because they didn't consider the fact that the word means something other than unintelligent and has a real effect on people means that it is me at fault for taking issue with it, and because the person in charge has never had to face the stigma of being labeled as inferior for the way your brain developed, it doesn't matter. When I have fought against those who call for the abolition of industry, even on anarchist subreddits, I have been banned on the basis of pointing out that people (like myself) rely on industry for the medicine we need to survive, and the abolition of it would kill all of us. Simply because they didn't consider the fact that there are people who don't have the benefit of being able to breathe without medical assistance or produce insulin on their own it means that I am at fault for taking issue with it, and because the person in charge has never had to worry if supply chain issues were going to literally kill them, people like me might as well not exist. I'm at a complete loss. If I can't even go to anarchist spaces without feeling like I have to fight to justify my right to be alive, then where is safe? Why are we always the last ones to matter? I'm beginning to lose hope that I'll ever live in a world in which I can just live without having to fight tooth and nail to protect my right to do so.

I think the idea of an apolitical world is an illusion. It is possible to eliminate authority, but it is impossible to eliminate the process of discussion, dissent, consensus and deliberation. People do this even in their personal relationships. What is bad is authoritarianism, abuse, coercion. And if you believe in ""I disagree, so I'm leaving"", that's voting with your feet. This is also a political act. It cannot be avoided. An apolitical world is utopian, because living in society demands discussing things with other people and making decisions collectively. Simply boycotting this because you don't agree doesn't make this boycott unpolitical, because the fact that you don't agree is already political, the fact that you have an opinion is already political, the fact that you express it is already political. A democracy that is libertarian allows people to freely disagree and disassociate themselves from the organization. You can always disagree, even in the majority model. You just can't force your will on others.
, which is authoritative. In general, there is a difference between the collective forcing you to do something or the collective saying that something someone does is not tolerable - such as authoritarianism, racism or xenophobia (ie, defense of fascism). Obviously I consider that the collective should never force someone to do something without consent, but I highly doubt that people on this forum and even you if you were in a group and saw a fascist with a Nazi flag and shouting racist things, that you would treat him as if that were freedom of speech, and greeted him as a comrade. You would probably do something.
Anyway, declaring things apolitical will not make politics disappear. If you talk to another person about how to do something, that's politics. What we're doing here is politics.

Oh please, you're not even op.

&gt;I'd like to point out that a lot of anarchists will completely forget the humans beyond the line.

It is a conscious decision on my end, class traitors such as the police do not inherently deserve anything from me. Especially whilst wearing their blood stained uniforms.

&gt;Those who serve are those who are oppressed, same as you and I.

There is a case to be made for the military, absolutely none to be made for the pigs.

&gt;And in some cases where the individual's interests truly involve the welfare of the people, we might be able to see better ways to convince the enforcers to leave their oppressors.

If the welfare of others really mattered, they would leave on their own. Torture is for the torturer, if they don't enjoy it, they  only have to stop. 

&gt; War should be avoided at all costs. Hate and vengeance will only hasten it.

They are the ones who turns the street we live in into warzones, they are the ones who specifically target vulnerable members of our communities and they are the one with the state god given right to murder, rape and pillage us.

What the fuck are you talking about ? We don't even have the means to declare any sort of war or vendetta.

&gt;Accusing this user of impurity for having doubts and conflicted information is not helpful

Lmfao, pointing out major cognitive dissonance is not the same as being a puritan. I obviously expect people to be minimally consequent with their beliefs, OP is not and thus got lightly called out on it. Such is life, OP is old enough to know how it works.

And I suggest not trying to sing kumbaya with the pigs when a nightstick is about to split your skull in half.

Before I get into their theory, I'm going to point out that the author acknowledged that ideologies are not scientific theories. So these explanations/predictions don't have to be testable or accurate -- they just have to be a way of interpreting the world.

Some of the main predictions of nationalism are:

1. Personal and cultural connections between people produce large scale structures in human society, which are identified as nations.
2. Relationships among people from the same nation tend to be 'better' (by whatever standard -- more productive, more fair, etc) than relationships between people from different nations, especially in large groups.
3. It is better to be ruled by someone from your own national group than by someone from a different national group.

It is elitist and intends to prevent the working class majority from socializing the production of a minority of slave oligarchs.
Democracy is not the rule of the majority, it is the self-rule of all. Proudhon objected to the republican centralism of the Jacobins, but his proposal for a federative system was composed of cooperatives and communes that would have direct democracy as a local basis. And democracy doesn't just mean majority voting. There are methods of decision-making by consensus, consent and even by lottery, in addition to the majority. Even in the majority, you can create a system of vetoes and amendments so that the minority has some power.
Every time I read about people saying democracy = majority rule and being against democracy, I wonder if they read more John Adams, Hamilton, Madison and even Edmund Burke than anarchist authors. Federalism and freedom of association avoid centralism, and there are internal ways to counterbalance majority rule within a democracy.

But I'll just point out that if someone has enough free time, and still chooses to pay for someone to take care of their children then, imo, that's simply bad parenting.

Which is one of those ironies of capitalism,

If you are a low income worker, either single parent or with a partner, if you have a child you either need to have someone of take care of her/him because you are working (and more than often doing extra hours and/or multiple jobs) or at least one of the partners ends up quit their job to take care of the child

Another simple example, is parking spots. If you have an high income, you can have a house with a garage, you can pay a motorist to drive you around, and in last resource even the fee of parking in the wrong place won't bother you. Meanwhile, if you have a low income, you either pay the fee of the parking spot you are in, or you have to drive around (wasting gas) looking for a free parking spot.

Law isn't made to protect the citizens, but rather to protect assets - or in other words, the capital.

In my city a permit was only required for selling food, not sharing. 
A permit was only required for large gatherings of over a certain number of people (I think 50? or something). 
So, We called it a picnic with our friends and left it at that. 
In that city we never got harrassed over actually sharing food, but... 
We got harassed over parking, they constantly took away our access to loading zones and stuff, but we just got a bunch of the people waiting to eat to help unload the trucks. 
We used to get water at the park but They took away our access to the water spigot, so we said fuck it and started hauling our own water or going across street to the library. 
Our FNB had many glorious reviews from happy customers who called it the best food share in the city and the five star street meal
The city never enforced the 50 people thing during my years there. we had maybe 100 come through every week it wasnt all at once. Now, some years before my time, this city hosted an extremely large political convergence for the presidential election. They started cracking down on all the food shares under guise of this 50-person limit. FNB was the only who resisted and continued sharing food outdoors. When there was over 50 people they simply moved a table across the street and said it was two separate picnics 
Also. Check out what happened to FNB in st Augustine FL. They were shut down by the city, then sued for violating their 1st amendment and won. This set a precedent for food sharing being considered a 1st amendment right. 
In other words, fuck them, do it anyway. Be proactive about issues before they arise, like get abreast of potential accusations of health violation by wearing gloves, sanitation station, etc. Dont let the bastards stop you. And pro tip, have some good fucking food, because it pulls numbers and ppl will support u more if you do. If you get a reputation for only having moldy lentils it will plague your name in that town for life good luck!!.",comment,/r/Anarchism/comments/wv5pgj/fear_of_being_prosecuted_for_serving_food_without/ilheyme/,Anarchism

Literally every single form of ideology or methodology hasn't trancended physical reality, even monarchs need to eat.

The usefulness of the framework becomes clearer when we look at another example your book gave, which is nationalism.

Irish nationalism skews much further left than the nationalism of most European nations because they're on the other side of colonial and imperial exploitation. Hopefully these examples make sense.

Taxes are one of the least egregious aspects of our current systems, but how the states use their taxes is another thing entirely. I for one am from Sweden, and here taxes used to finance state owned welfare like schools and healthcare.

This has happened to the entire school system, a large part of healthcare, the postal service, the drug store, the train networks, the telephone service providers, and now just this year Arbetsfrmedlingen (job matching agency) got the same treatment. We still pay, but now the money goes to the top 0.1% instead of back to the people.

Another thing we do with taxes is we give out insane subsidies. For example, if you take a private jet the state will pay you 30k sek (around $3k). Per flight. Or when rent or electricity prices soar, they'd rather pay part of your bill (essentially just giving these companies tax money) instead of capping prices at levels people can afford.

Not all municipalities necessarily require permits, and if they do the permit type might vary (for instance in some places only those with commercial kitchen licenses can get permits) but if you frame it this way then I think it'd be unlikely you'd get more than a warning if the city wanted to go after you.

Alternatively, you could volunteer with the most radicalish shelter/food-pantry you can find for a couple of weeks, and then ask them questions about what kind of permits they have, how often they get visits from city health inspectors, etc.

Finally, not a lawyer but the VAST majority of municipalities would consider this a city code violation, i.e. below even a misdemeanor (like the level of a parking ticket), so I wouldn't worry about anything too serious. But if you're nervous about that, definitely find a rad buddy to work on this project with so you don't have to feel like you're shouldering all the risk/anxiety on your own. Or if there's a radical bookstore/infoshop/meetup/etc. near you see if they can give you some support.

Anarcho feminism and Queer Anarchism as I understand it simply analyze and put anarchy into action based on feminist and queer lenses respectively, and might also be used to identify affinity groups within a larger movement. People like me  who have learned a lot from Queer and feminist anarchists likely wouldnt even call them different ideologies per se, but overlapping strands of analysis, history, and resistance to similar modes of oppression, that are a part of the same ideology (anarchism). 

I would also certainly think of Anarcho Communism as an ideology, as well as egoism, and you can have a group that heavily identifies with Queer Anarchism be evenly split between those who are egoists and AnComs. So I think theres some conflation between ideology (Anarchism) vs lenses of resistance (queer and feminist anarchy), and ideology vs subsets of said ideology (egoism, AnarchoCommunism, anarcho socialism, etc.) 

I also wouldnt necessarily say that Anarchism is a methodology (though some arguments are convincing). I can think of a lot of ways in which anarchists are united by methods and tactics which we *dont* practice (voting and absolute rejection of violence come to mind). However, I dont think Id be able to outline a specific methodology or set of tactics for Anarchy. Sure theres direct action and a rejection of hierarchy, but there are a million ways to engage in direct action, with many anarchists opposing some tactic for one reason or another. Rejection of hierarchy is something that were united on, but *how* we go about that can be hotly contested, and being anti-hierarchical in and of itself isnt really a method for *how* those hierarchies are dismantled.

As much as I hate police, if I were a therapist (Im definitely not but I was raised by one) I would appreciate the intervention of others who could handle a situation of that magnitude when its beyond the scope of my ability. 


Therapists deserve help and safety also. 


What I would do is focus less on the symptoms youre experiencing but rather on finding tools to manage what seems to be anxiety/sadness or whatever other feelings youre having that are causing you to feel such a strong need to get help with managing them. Being suicidal is not a diagnosis in itself but rather a symptom of your diagnosed condition. Theres nothing for you to be ashamed of, but ask yourself what can I reasonably do to just a little bit feel better in this moment?. Have you ever made a list of activities you actually enjoy, or sought out some coping skills you could use in the meantime, like EFT, any relaxation apps or guided meditations (if you feel safe to try these). When you do get connected to a therapist, they will likely want to pursue trauma therapy with you, and the current gold standard of trauma therapy is EMDR or Somatic Experiencing, and some other things to try might be CBT or DBT, if your therapist is not trained in either of those. Neurofeedback is another lesser known method of helping neural pathways heal but its kind of expensive. Just mentioning it for something to look into. 


The way you speak about things matters. How can we focus less on not wanting to unalive oneself and reframe that into a more positive statement: I want to live a more fulfilling life and be a more cohesive person, one where the parts of me that have been fragmented are more integrated. The intensity of my feelings are very strong, likely due to trauma Ive suffered. I would like for someone to help me find hope to heal myself because I am unsure how to cope with the future.

Find some LGBT friendly centers that provide mental health services in your area. Call them and say just what I typed. Or send an email to every therapist who takes your insurance. Youve got to fight for yourself. You are worth fighting for. If you dont have health insurance, California is one of the best states to get state funded health insurance. 

Psychiatrists will just give you pills. If you dont want the pills then stop seeing psychiatrists. I made that same decision for myself when they were all making me feel worse. I decided to buckle down and heal my nervous system of my trauma. Its a work in progress. Some days are better than others. I find reasons to keep going.  


Do you have any support at all? Any friends or anyone to help you get where you need to go or at least body double for you to fill out paperwork and sit with you in waiting rooms? I can only imagine how difficult this all has been for you. 
I want to tell you this: you have the power to focus your attention on having a life that feels good to you. It may take a lot of steps to get there, a lot of patience with yourself and with others. You did not deserve what happened to you. You are not a bad person.

I make sure I explicitly state that I am not ideating (making a plan). It seems like the other commenters are saying that this is not typical and that its really easy to get reported. I would believe this. I know Im lucky to have found the best therapist for me. Ive only ideated once since Ive been seeing her and it was because of a medication I was on and so I asked her to help me sort my thoughts out and made the decision to stop taking that particular medication during the session. It was a pain medication. I take my anti-depressant. It doesnt help much. 

Ive been in a psych hospital for suicidality. I checked in voluntarily but nothing felt voluntary once I was there. Theyre typically awful and Im so sorry youve experienced that, let alone more than once. 

I dont think my therapist is an anarchist (yet- perhaps Ill help coax her there) but she is definitely far left. Its helpful. She also knows that psych hospitals are awful, but has explained to me well in what scenarios she would have to report me. 

I think other systems might give some good advice. I am a singlet. 

I am also trans and starting hrt helped my mental health a lot. That being said, I have PTSD and of course the hrt doesnt help with that, but therapy finally has. It took me 20 years to find my current therapist and no one else helped me much before that. I think treating your trauma might help in the long run. 

I would not mention suicidal thoughts to a therapist until/unless youre sure they will not report you. It sounds like hospitalization would harm you more than help you. But that takes time to get comfortable and to be able to ask a lot of questions to determine where the line is. 

Its obvious you need more immediate help though. Im sorry that the world is not set up for help to be easier to find and more accessible. What helped me all the years I was waiting to find the right therapist for me was trying to form and maintain supportive relationships. I stopped talking to and spending any time with people who harmed my mental health and made sure I talked more and spent more time with people who made me feel supported. I wrote things down that helped (quotes and stuff) and put them on walls in areas where I spent a lot of time. I tried to eat healthy and get plenty of rest and to be gentle to myself when I didnt succeed in it. I day-dreamed of how things could be. It technically fit the criteria for maladaptive daydreaming but it kept me here so whatever. I spent time around trees and dogs because thats helpful for me. In therapy, I talked about little things that bothered me and tried to work through the things I thought a particular therapist could help with because all those little things add up. I dont drink because thats always been a bad idea for me, but for years marijuana helped although it just makes me anxious now.

The inevitable end that all socialism strives for is communism. Even Stirner and Proudgon were socialist. So knowingly or not every anarchist strives for communism.

The enemy whose tactics of global genocide against non-white &amp; non-Christian indigenous people made them the most popular religion in history.

As all through history Kings controlled the Christian religion, just as the ruling monarch of England is the head of the Protestant Church of England today and throughout English history.

The British saying of The sun never sets on the empire. is a tribute to their global genocide in the name of the Protestant God.

The global popularity of Christianity is due to a society mass brainwashed by the violent history &amp; lies of Christianity combined with Stockholm Syndrome, with generation after generation of conquered people, just like they did in America.

But at the time, there was no Fed, no particular monetary theory (Keynes, Hayek, Mises and others were yet to come), the US was still on the gold standard, etc, income tax was new and totally different.

22Jul22 I silenced the Texas Secession group on FB. I debated the admin of the group on their beliefs in religion and politics proving with history they could fact-check themselves that what they believed were lies, from God to Patriotism, and that everything they thought Christianity &amp; the Republican Party stood for, were lies.  
  
Read it yourself, find out why no one has posted in the group since.  
The Texas Secession Group on Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/TexasSuccession](https://www.facebook.com/TexasSuccession)

Try to prove me wrong bleater, and you will prove yourself wrong instead.

I have been proven wrong a lot to get to this position in my life.

I'm one of the uneducated, I'm a GED holder and am self-taught.  
  
2015 to 2017 I was one of the global moderators for the Neil DeGrasse Tyson Public Science Group on FB, made so on merit by the admins, an engineer &amp; astrophysicist. Never had talked with the admins, just logged in one-day &amp; I had the moderator panel.  
  
I learn when I am proven wrong with evidence I can verify on my own.  
  
None of you seem to be able to prove you can learn, given the evidence you can fact-check and learn from what I've placed in front of you, your egos won't let you admit when you're wrong.  
  
I can prove allI say, YOU can prove all I say, and I'll prove that to any person or group, anyplace, anytime, that I have an active account on, like this group, here &amp; now.  
  
So, I put my ""money"" where my mouth was 26Aug20 when I bet all my social media accounts that no one could prove me wrong in religion or politics.

No one has, because no one can.

&gt; How the U.S. gave away a breakthrough battery technology to China Taxpayers spent $15 million on research to build a breakthrough battery.

&gt; The department is now conducting an internal review of the licensing of vanadium battery technology and whether this license - and others - have violated U.S. manufacturing requirements, the statement said.

&gt; As battery work took off in China, Yang was facing more financial trouble in the U.S. So he made a decision that would again keep the technology from staying in the U.S. The EU has strict rules about where companies manufacture products.
